With less than 100 employees, the Vine team is a tight-knit group, who are all obviously passionate about the platform.

I also got to travel quite a bit which was nice. The work was pretty typical application development work, mainly with React and React Native. There's rumours about poor work/life balance but I think that's only on certain teams/offices. I didn't notice anything too crazy when I was there.",

The code was all in C++ and I had a hard time digging through the code because this is really old code with some complicated logic. Overall this team was great and the people seemed to have a great work life balance. Much like any other big company, you have to remember that the experience ends up depending on your team and your mentor. I knew people who hated it but I loved my time here! Also Microsoft doesn't really have an on site gym but they do give you a membership to the Pro Club which is better than any gym I've ever been to and its close to the Redmond campus. Besides this, Microsoft is really generous about their intern events for the summer term (not really for the other terms) and they give an intern gift to every intern! ",

    "description": "Microsoft Japan is unlike any other internship experience and obviously that is mostly because of the location. I'm going to list out the pros and cons for this internship in detail since there are not many international students who intern here.\n\nPros: \n1. It's in Tokyo! Their office is in shinagawa and its so easy to get to any place in Tokyo. Weekends and evenings are always so fun. This is the main reason I give it a 5 star. If traveling or living in Tokyo for 4 months doesn't excite you then maybe this isn't the internship for you.\n2. They put you up in a nice studio apartment close to shinagawa. For me, my apartment was in Tamachi station but I heard some people were in a different location. Either way it is paid for and pretty nice. It's a little small but definitely enough for one person. \n3. The Japan team only hires international interns on the office team and the office team in Japan unlike Redmond is very small. They only have the Sway and Docs.com team and a bit of Office Lens I believe. This is a pro and a con. It's a pro because you get to know the team. It's very open concept unlike Microsoft in general. The con is that you might not want to work on these products at all. \n4. Companies in Japan have a interesting culture. People there work reallllly late but this isn't true for Microsoft Japan. I mean people did work late but I never felt any pressure to do so. It would be like any other company in Silicon Valley etc. \n\nCons:\n1. Salary. You will not save any money if you come here. If you're using your internships to pay for school then re evaluate this internship. We got paid around 2.5 CAD before tax/health insurance. They do reimburse you for the flights though. I heard that the the term after us started getting paid 400000 yen which is about 4000 CAD (at least when I interned there). But even then Japan is an expensive place and if you want to travel and eat good food this money will be enough to live there but not to save and bring back.\n2. Language barrier. Fewer people than I expected spoke English in Tokyo. Get used to using google translate or learn some Japanese. This can sometimes be frustrating because buying milk can be difficult but at the same time if you're considering this then I assume you have some interest in learning about the culture and language.

I only had about five one on one meetings: a few at the beginning of the internship, one at the midterm review, and one at the final review. He was nice at least and when I emailed him he would respond. He did offer me resources on how to learn what I needed for my project.\n\nI didn't finish my project, but afterwards someone else on the team finished it and it ended up in production which is cool.\n\nI did learn stuff at this internship since I hadn't used the technology and languages before. \n\nThe work life balance was great because interns weren't expected to work the same hours as the full timers. Full time employees generally work 9 am - 6 pm/7 pm. I worked 9 pm - 5 pm.\n\nThere weren't many perks. There were a few corporate discounts at tourist attractions. It was also free to ride the ferry across the Hudson to NYC during the work day since there were offices on both sides of the river. \n\nI did get to meet several people in senior leadership while I was there. The managing directors all tried to make time to meet some of the interns and it was sometimes effective to reach out directly to the MDs and ask to meet them.",

Based on your project, you are also assigned a mentor. The work itself can vary from being important to being an improvement to an internal tool. Having the choice to do either based on how you rank your preference of projects is pretty handy. Depending on your mentor you may have more or less support from them. \n\nThe work/life balance is pretty good for interns. You are not required to stay late at all. There is catered lunches twice a week, but the sandwich/salad bar is available everyday. There are also lots of snacks and drinks.

    "description": "I interned at Facebook in Winter 2016. To start off, Facebook pays very competitively when you consider the base salary, luxury housing, intern \u0026 team events, inter-office travel, and perks. Large signing bonuses are attached with a full time return offer and you will not need to do technical interview to be considered. Facebook is a large company so your experience and work largely depends on you and your team. The matching process is mostly arbitrary so you are unlikely to be matched with your dream team. Teams have different dynamics so reviews and first hand experiences are mostly based on these individual experiences. The intern program at Facebook provides resources for a intern to shape the internship the way they want it to be. Despite the variety in teams, work life balance, and the difficulty of work, it all gets normalized in the end when they compare and contrast the intern class as a whole. The culture, despite being a large company, revolves around openness and seeking your own work, so it is always possible to salvage a poor team placement. I was lucky and was placed on a great team (Live Video) which ultimately resulted in my most challenging and rewarding internship up to this point (5th term).",

    "description": "I worked in the Boutros Lab at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research during the Summer of 2015. This was a research lab which applied machine learning techniques to cancer research. The lab actively participates in machine learning competitions related to bioinformatics such as the DREAM challenges (as it is similar to the work done in the lab and it can improve your skill with similar datasets).\n\nAs a software engineer here I got to work on both machine learning competitions and software engineering work. For the machine learning competitions I cleaned and transformed data in R, then ran it through the pipeline of feature selection and extraction, then the actual algorithms, then maybe some stacking. The software engineering work was pretty standard and related to maintaining and improving the libraries that are in use by the lab. At the time of my internship the codebase was R (for science related tasks) and perl (for systems related tasks). There are some libraries which have grown convoluted over the years being written as one-off research code which then is hacked to be reused. As a software engineering intern I had to refactor some of this spaghetti code.\n\nEvery week there was a lab meeting where there was one small and one large presentation by lab members. This was interesting to me as I got to learn about the different projects people had and how they used different ML models in order to make sense of the biological data. Sometimes it was very biology heavy which did offset me from understanding what they were presenting.\n\nThe lab members were very friendly and helpful, being experienced in their respective fields of expertise. Usually there are also other interns doing either similar software engineering work or bioinformatics research. Most of the full time lab members are bioinformaticians with a handful of software engineers which was kind of intimidating since I don't know much biology so I feared talking to the bioinformaticians (which was probably a mistake as they are strong programmers for academic work, which has different priorities but nonetheless they probably know many tricks that I could have learnt, especially with manipulating data in R).\n\nThe lab is in downtown Toronto right next to a subway station and there is a food court at the bottom of the building with ~10 selections. Exiting the building there are many great food places just a 5-10 minutes walk away.\n\nOverall the experience was great and I learnt a lot. The things that I have learnt about and value most probably is the data science experience as I use it in the current internships that I have.",

I can't think of anything you'd want in a job that it doesn't provide: \n1. Work life balance: The office is empty by 6pm, and I was actually discouraged from working more than 8 hours. \n2. Quality of work: PagerDuty tackles some very interesting problems and as a devops company, the way it handles its infrastructure is absolutely superb; even the most seasoned developers will learn a lot from their solutions.\n3. Co-workers: It's not unprecedented for a successful company located in SV to have so many intelligent engineers. However, the way it stands out from most other companies in the bay area is the empathy, humility, and genuine goodness of the people there. The most skilled engineers have the smallest egos and would often give me credit for work that I had a part in, even if it was mostly facilitated by them\n4. Pay: Scales by around $500/month as you are promoted every term (for SF office). The pay for the fifth work term is 1.5K stipend + 7.5k. Extremely generous, and is higher than the pay of many top tech companies.\n5. Perks: Free lunch everyday, free breakfast every Wednesday, planned fitness room, nap room, beautiful office space, freedom to work from home at your own discretion, monthly company wide hackdays.",

It varies per team, of course, but I would say it's not for everyone. You work on really impactful projects meaning you also get very tied to its deadlines. Many employees work long, busy days. I would say, however, that for an internship it really kicks you into shape and even if you work a day or two in the weekends here and there it's absolutely worth it since you know you're doing valuable work and the customer impact is very direct. And at the end of the day an internship is only for 4 months or so. When I was there we also did plenty of fun things with the other interns (and full timers).",

Some weeks we worked 10 hours, others we worked 25, but never the promised 35hrs and our paychecks were coming a month late and CECA had mentioned that the co-op term might not count at all even though I got the job through jobmine. At some point our supervisor said he doesn't have any more traffic jobs for the summer so he was thinking of letting some co-ops go. I spent the second half of the term in the office coding and designing products in solidworks (both things that weren't anywhere in the job description and requirements), which basically meant that the obly meaningful work I did that term was work that wasn't initially going to be worked on by me.",

I wasn't really given many options to branch out into what I was interested in. I worked mostly modifying internal API responses to facilitate the building of a few smaller features. The main feature I worked on wasn't particularly that complex or interesting; hence, the low rating for the quality of work.  Work-life balance was essentially enforced for interns, since interns are paid hourly and overtime is discouraged. However, because of this hourly system, interns are also not paid for any holidays (i.e. I was only paid for 24h during the week of Thanksgiving).",

These events were a good way of getting to know people. Another perk is they provide a housing search service, so you don't have to spend hours combing through Craigslist -- this proved to be super useful.

I worked with programmers so there was none of that, but it showed with the university management. There's a lot of office politics which made everything 1000x more complicated, and the lack of proper management made everyone's work excessively harder. Also the pay was incredibly low while nothing except the visa was subsidized, which was almost not because they didn't know we had to pay another fee when we pick it up. HR rejected to pay it until the full-times talked to finance and clarified that it's supposed to be paid.\nWe had some exciting events and things in the road map, but in the end all I got was marketing and administrative work even though I wanted to do more hands-on work.

While I was there the company was about 800 strong with 150 devs in total.\n\nInterns were paid hourly and also allowed 10 hours of overtime per week which is great if you're trying to dish out a little more cash. Intern housing was also amazing with most interns living right across the street from the office (literally door to door was around 5 minutes). While they don't provide free meals, there is are a few well kept snack walls and fridges full of basic commodities like eggs and milk.\n\nThe intern situation was amazing with a tight knit group of ~20 dev interns. Intern events were also absolutely amazing, with great events such as touring Hollywood, going to Disneyland, and going to concerts on the beach. Another added bonus was that all intern events were paid events (and with Disneyland being a 16 hour day...).",

    "description": "Great company, super interesting and a great place. Good food, outstanding pay, coworkers are awesome, get to work in OCaml, nice office. There's also fun dinners and events for interns and mentors. It's a fun and casual work environment with interesting technology, far from a stereotypical finance company.\n\nThe program is pretty structured. You do 3-5 self-contained small-ish projects, each one with a different mentor. Each one is interesting, takes a few weeks, and are often in a variety of different areas, which is nice. You don't get the same experience as a full time employee working on a team though.\n\nIf I was forced to find cons it would be the intern sandbox and the corporate IT setup. Interns are heavily firewalled with little access to the intranet and internal data, which is a bit sad since you can't actually see the things you make running in production. Also you need to use a CentOS computer without root access, the IT people are helpful and can install things for you, but only from the sparse and outdated CentOS repos. They have good reasons for both of these, but it doesn't stop them from being minor annoyances. You also have to do all your work on a remote server (but with sub-millisecond ping and gigabit bandwidth), which makes GUI editors like Sublime Text harder to use.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, that's just nitpicking. It's really a great place to work. I enjoyed it so much that despite getting 6 days of vacation I only took one, despite not knowing that I'd be payed out for the days I didn't take. I was a short flight away from all sorts of neat European destinations, and the thing I wanted to do most was work there more. Taking them was actually encouraged, I just didn't want to.",

    "description": "I recently applied for the position of an intern as a software developer and after a rigorous interview process got selected. Here is my interview experience in brief:\nThe whole interview was classified into 4 rounds.\n\nRound 0: It was an online contest hosted on Hackerrank(90 mins). There were 3 questions, one was string based(medium), the second was a dynamic programming(easy), and third was a dynamic programming(medium hard). Doing one problem was enough, though it depends on the actual rank list and not the number of problems you solve. This was followed by a debug round, a question on binary exponentiation. We just had to correct the code and submit within 15 mins.\n\nRound 1: This was a GoToMeeting interview. The interview was all about your resume. The interviewer asked about the projects in detail for about 30 mins and then in general everything about your experience with past internships and stuff.\n\nRound 2: This was an online coding round. I was given a question on binary trees, had to find the maximum sum path in the tree and code it up within 40 mins. The interviewer expects you to go step by step in this round, that is first you give a brute force solution and then progressively try to decrease the time complexity until the interviewer is satisfied. (Tip: Don't jump to the answer directly even if you know the answer beforehand. They are not interested in the fact that you know a problem but they test your approach to a new problem.)This was followed by a general discussion about the resume again.\n\nRound 3: This was a problem design round, basically to check how you go about solving a problem and how much of your computer science concepts are clear. Firstly, the interviewer presented a problem about recommendations made on an online e-commerce website. I had to suggest how all this could have been done. Another question was to design a bot that wished your facebook friends automatically. Another question was about distributed systems, he posted a query which needed to be parallelized, and you had to discuss all the aspects of it. Basically what the interviewer was looking for was that you understand your solution inside out and know about all of its shortcomings that may occur and then he would ask you to somehow solve these shortcomings.\n\nThis was all about it. It was a great experience interviewing with Codenation. Note that interviewing opportunity can only be obtained by participating in the Codeagon contest conducted by Codenation. I think you need to be in the top 100 or so for getting to interview. This first process may vary a little depending on a lot of things. So keep your eye on their facebook page for the update. About all the perks and the compensation, I feel that Codenation is transparent enough and has all the details mentioned on their website.",

Within a few weeks, we had completed most of it and at this point, my role was simply to provide support to teams as they onboarded onto this new project. I asked to be removed from this as I was told this was a developer job and not a technical support job. \n\nI was removed from that project and put onto testing some small app. This took 2 weeks. After this, I would work on small random proof of concept projects for 1-2 weeks which would end up getting scrapped. The last 3 weeks I had no project at all - I approached my manager at least 10 times during the whole internship asking for more work and was told that they simply didn't have any for me.\n\nAll in all, I was quite disappointed with the internship. Why did they hire me if they didn't have any projects to put me on? I didn't learn much other than some high level architecture stuff. I was quite happy with the salary for my first year and saved quite a bit as I was able to live at home, but holy crap were those the longest 8 hours of my life (alternating between reddit, hotspotting on my phone to watch youtube and taking walks around the office).",

This means Kik deals with complex problems with little manpower to solve them, which allows interns to have a high degree of responsibility. You will learn a lot here and you'll definitely come out of the internship a much better developer than before. Also the snacks in the kitchenette are great, not to mention the free catered lunch, and dinner (at 5pm so you don't have to stay too late).\n\nCons: Kik is a small company and has monolithic Facebook as it's main competitor, so it has a lot to prove with few people. This means that work/life balance suffers and there isn't much focus on having a chill work environment, so the workday tends to become dry and purely work focused. Also, while interns are treated like full timers, there is definitely a gap in that while interns have the responsibilities of full timers, there's not much mentorship given to interns which makes it harder to form good relationships with coworkers.",

Coming into the role with no office experience and still lacking in many other areas as well, both my managers were very kind in helping me develop my skills by asking me what I wanted to improve on and assigning me relevant tasks. The amount of work was strictly performed during work hours - so I had a great work life balance and the type of work could easily be traced to who it's impacting. \n\nThere wasn't many perks - but there was always snacks and candy on a drawer back when I was there, not sure if it's there anymore...",

Some developers never want to fix the bugs you found. Mentorship is god awful. The people working at Kik are very young and most of them haven't been in the industry for too long, so it's kind of hard trying to find someone to look up to.

    "description": "I worked there Fall 2016. I was the only intern that term so ended up with a great studio apartment just by the Bay Bridge, 20 min walk from the office. I ended up working on JavaScript infrastructure stuff (static asset management/bundling, front-end build scripts, cache-busting etc.) which I enjoyed immensely and felt was very meaningful to the front-end developers. (I had the option to work on various web dev oriented teams. From what I understand most interns end up on client-facing stuff using Python + JavaScript.) I ended up doing a lot of code reviews, as well as getting my own code reviewed, which I feel I learned a lot from.\n\nThe product itself has so many moving parts, and it's difficult to understand how they all fit together, so I didn't develop any interest for the client facing stuff in my time there (largely because all my work was internal).\n\nMy mentor was PHENOMENAL. Weekly sync up meetings to see how I was enjoying myself, exceptional knowledge of everything we were working on and more, encouraged me to work on open-source stuff, organized so many events, the list goes on.\n\nI felt at home at the company really quickly - everyone is very friendly and the culture is relaxed. I didn't feel any pressure to work extra hard and I wasn't afraid to make mistakes or open pull-requests early. Regular company events (Giants games, beer bashes, etc.) really contributed to the chill atmosphere. I'm relatively quiet so didn't always attend events, but I never felt pressured to participate or drink if I didn't want to.\n\nFor my first term in the US (incidentally my final co-op term), it's hard to imagine a better experience. It seemed like the perfect place to work while exploring a new city, what with the location, the provided housing, the flexible work hours, the work I ended up doing, and the people I was working with.",

I started as part of the Explore Program, chose to come back as a PM and will be returning this upcoming summer for my 3rd internship. \n\nI know others have talked about unenthusiastic teams, bad mentors, and bad managers. I understand. My first summer, my manager was horrible, chastising my abilities and my work. I expressed my concerns with my mentor, and thankfully, she was able to help me. The CEO said \"people don't quit companies, they quit teams\", which struck a chord with me. I decided to return the next summer as part of a different team. (I also found out that summer that my previous manager had been moved down to the position of Individual Contributor)\n\nI was also able to connect with someone on the UX Design team for HoloLens that summer and she took me under her wing. Because of the experiences I had with people outside of my team, I gave Microsoft a second chance. It was worth it. I had a phenomenal summer and created the initial prototype of an internal tool that is going to be used company wide and by the end of my internship they had decided to ship it. My mentor was extremely supportive and pushed me in the right direction to join her team and I will be returning next summer to work on UX Design for HoloLens. The people on my team this summer were amazing and it was well worth putting up with one bad manager to get to a better place.",

Perks include but are not limited to: frequent intern events, quarterly offsites, and lunch on Fridays.\n\nPart of your experience depends on the team you're on and the project you're assigned. I believe your second round interviewers will recommend teams for you to be placed on so be sure to let them know where your interests lie and what kind of work you want to do.\n\nSome aspects that don't depend on team and project are the work-life balance and company culture. The vast majority of engineers, PMs, and managers I interacted with were very smart and approachable. Seize opportunities to check out what other teams are doing, through yelp-beans, show and tell sessions like web sync, or ask a recruiter to arrange a meeting with another team lead.\n\nOverall, I had a great time at Yelp thanks to the quality of people it attracts and the company's commitment to providing a solid internship experience.",

In the Seattle office the bigger teams are Ads and Messenger. I was on Ads and the work was impactful and challenging but fun. Facebook also has amazing internal tooling, processes, and support; meaning we get to spend more time on meaningful work rather than dealing with trivial setup and issues.\n2) Perks: FB definitely has one of the best perks among the top tech companies. There's the usual free food, mini kitchens, pingpong/foosball, and gyms, but FB also provides free housing on top of your salary, professional laundry on-site (includes dry cleaning), bike stipend, wellness stipend, a phone with an unlimited plan for the term, and a wide selection of tech equipment. \nAlso, if you are in Seattle, there are many chances to go to HQ (I went 5/6 times during my term). If you do, FB pays for the flight, hotels, rental cars, and food if you eat out. \n3) Culture: Work life balance is great, everyone is very friendly and helpful (especially if you tell them you're an intern). There are many hackathons and intern events that you can take part in, as well as company-wide events, clubs, and learning sessions. Leadership is also great. Mark Zuckerberg is very transparent with employees and hosts a Q/A every friday where anyone can ask anything about the company.\n",

There's also a lot of politics for a company of this size (~100 people) and the management team seems to push for things like unlimited vacation as a means to make up for the lack of work life balance.

Afterwards, there tends to be a lot less hand holding for interns. It is usually up to the intern to seek their supervisor if they need help. It was normal for me to see my supervisor once or twice a day to talk about any issues on my project, but it was normal for another intern to meet their supervisor just once a week for a regular update.\n\nEveryone in the office is very laid back and open to helping one another.

    "description": "There seems to be a disconnect between upper management and the typical employees. A lot of the founders and upper management seem to have drank the Kool-Aid and think they're the greatest thing since sliced bread. There's also a structural disconnect between the two offices (Waterloo and Bangalore), where the culture of the Indian office seems to clash with the culture at the local office—one of the teams I encountered during my time there measured the state of a project by \"how many lines of code remaining to write\", which is a totally useless metric and given as an estimate at the start of the project.\n\nTheir technology is somewhat dated, although it varies by team. A lot of the company used an old VCS (IBM ClearCase), although they were beginning to transition to their own hosted Gitlab instance. Also, they have a lot of their testing infrastructure written in a rather esoteric language that nobody really seems to use anymore—Tcl. Java, C and C++ make up a majority of the rest of their codebase, although they were beginning to embrace newer technologies like Golang (for some newer services) and node.js (mostly for client-facing things). I think some teams use Python as well.\n\nI worked on the Subscriber Policy Broker (SPB) team, and the project I was given was pretty isolated from the rest of the team. It was a pretty important project for the company, and I basically had full control over it during my co-op term, which I drove to completion during my time there. As such, I didn't really have to deal with all the politics, and had little interaction with the rest of the team. Half of my team was remote (in Bangalore), and the other half was in Waterloo.\n\nFrom my perspective, it seemed as if the full-time employees would always be dealing with some sort of production issue during their on-call rotation, and would work rather long hours in order to ensure that their projects were on track. However, as a co-op, I didn't really have to deal with that, and basically did my own thing, working 35-40 hours per week. Basically, as long as I was on track and producing results, they didn't really mind what I did.\n\nThey had monthly social events, a popcorn machine, foosball/ping-pong table, free pop, and beer on tap (usually some craft beer).",

    "description": "TL:DR: If you want to build projects from the ground up with complete control over tech-stack and implementation, and are comfortable with self learning and having little to no mentorship, then LCBO next might just be what you are looking for.\n\nPros:\n- Small team: just 4 coops + a non-technical manager (they did just hire a full time dev though).\n- No BS meetings: Once the specs were decided on, people were left to work distraction free\n- Many small projects: we had 3 different projects over the span of 4 months.\n- Full tech-stack \u0026 creative control: we started 2/3 projects from nothing more than a blank Git repo and a rough set of specs from the higher-ups. True 0 Technical Debt™\n- Modern Development: The Frontends were SPAs build with React + Redux, and the Backends were node.js with Express, Passport, Sequelize + Postgres, Docker, etc... Our mobile apps used Swift or React-Native.\n- Communitech: it's a really nice place to work. Communitech in general has a nice atmosphere, and LCBO next has a really nice work-area. Also, there is a gym in the building.\n\nCons:\n- Some Corporate BS: There are times where LCBO's corporate machine clashes with the fast pace of innovation. Eg: we were once blocked on a project for several weeks due to internal bureaucracy in getting access to some internal data.\n- No Mentorship: (this might change with the recently hired dev) We didn't have anyone on-site to help up with any technical questions we had. We built everything ourselves, and when we ran into problems, we overcame them ourselves too. NOTE: this isn't really a con, more of a fact really...\n- No Free Food (barring the occasional Communitech event) \n- No Free Company Swag\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my internship at LCBO next. I got a chance to finally learn and polish my skills with a wide array of different technologies, and it felt great to have such complete control over the projects I was working on.",

If you finish your main project quickly, then you'll probably end up working on regular engineering tasks. The projects were in different fields, and a couple of them were quite interesting (involved NLP, OpenGL), but a lot of them were fairly standard web/mobile-development feature tasks. Obviously, these choices will vary each term.\n\nHours aren't particularly long, but they're pretty offset from the usual business hours (most people came in at 11 and left after 7). You're not pressured to commit to 11-7 at all though. Your mentor is mostly there to answer any questions you have, but you'll need to be fairly proactive in asking questions to get anything meaningful from them. I wasn't so proactive, and mostly ended up asking my mentor for help with Japanese paperwork.\n\nLiving in Japan is great, and there's a lot to see, do and eat. I highly recommend you take lots of trips on weekends and holidays!",

If you are lucky, you might work on some small features that actually ship. Company culture is really strange, everyone is super secretive about what they are working on. The company is also extremely stingy with perks, offering no free breakfast/dinner and free dinner only if you stay past 7 PM. Overall, I think that Apple is a good company to work at if you are into hardware or are a massive fan boy. If you are into software, there are better companies out there.",

They are also really flexible, and try to accommodate to your interests; I was initially assigned an Android project, since my resume has a lot of Android experience. However, I really wanted to learn something new, and my manager was able to accommodate to my learning needs. The corporate housing is luxurious and EVERYTHING at work is free!!!!! (Food, tech, snacks, etc...) The team and managers really try to ensure you have a good work-life balance, and encourage you to have fun at the campus arcade and bouldering rock!

Some aspects of the development process were a little slow for my liking, but as an intern I was treated no differently than a full-time dev. One perk of working at the CBC is that every 5th week is an innovation sprint, where you can work on a side project or learn something new that adds value to the company. Working in downtown Toronto is also very cool.",

All the recruiters and managers I worked with were approachable as well. I was an intern in the Notifications Team. I worked with engineers who were from great schools and who had worked in Amazon and Microsoft before Redfin. They let you choose any team and project you want based on your interest. I loved the flexibility. The work culture is great and there is a lot of great mentorship and work-life balance. We also had team events to increase team morale. Overall, I would highly recommend Redfin as an internship, especially someone who is interested in Big Data problems and the Real-Estate business.",

    "description": "Had a fantastic experience with Ciena at their Ottawa location. My team, and specifically my boss, were fantastic to work with. Didn't get any busy work after the first few weeks, was actually given meaningful work that taught me important software development practices and more. My boss specifically took me aside at times to highlight important things both about my work and thriving in a corporate environment. Team were all super friendly and helpful.\n\nPositive outlook on the company as a whole. Work life balance is there as most of the company is just people looking to do their ~40 hours and enjoy life outside of work. The occasional weekend of overtime would be asked in order to hit a target date but this seemed to be a very infrequent thing. Cool product and the company looks to be heading in the right direction.\n\nA few footnotes:\n\n1. Company is aging. Ciena Ottawa is a lot of former Nortel employees, and the company really didn't hit their stride until recently. This has created a bit of a hiring gap where you have a lot of employees aged 40+ but very few in the late twenties/early thirties area. They've been hiring a lot of new grads so there is definitely youth there.\n2. Canadian pay. You can see their fulltime numbers easy enough on glassdoor and it's nothing exceptional as far as Canadian software goes. They have decent perks for employees who have stuck with the company for a bit, and I get the vibe that this is a \"work here for potentially the rest of your life\" kind of place. Having experienced both this environment and the much faster paced, swap companies frequently, higher paid environment of the states, I am not sure which I prefer. Two completely different paths which I believe both have their benefits.\n\nAnyways, as far as co-op goes you can't go wrong spending some time here. Great company, great people, good work, and Ottawa is a fantastic place to live. Give it a shot and see if it's for you.",

Super exciting to work at one of the best self driving car company in the world right now, I worked in a very small team (a special feature) of 2 people, I basically owned the entire feature stack, my work involved everything from frontend, backend, server scalability, data pipeline to the autonomous vehicle stack on the car. To put it simply, I learned a shit load.\n\nWork is very meaningful and relevant, company is evaluated by milestone, therefore everything I worked on was purely towards the milestones, and the impact of my work is clearly visible from metrics and benchmarks. \n\nCompany is growing extremely rapidly, we have about 300 full time right now, though the managements are doing a great job aligning the focus, especially the CEO who is also super down to earth and friendly. However as a consequence it can be difficult to get help just because the pace of the company's growth, it sometimes take a couple of redirecting to get to the right person. If you can self learn quickly then it isn't a problem.\n\nThe company is actively pushing equality and healthy work culture *cough cough uber*, there are 15 interns this summer, the intern program is new but also well planned, lots of intern events. The expectations of interns are just about the same as full time, still the workload is very resonable, and the work hours are very flexible. \n\nLots of benefits: free breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, deductable commute, free self driving car ride to work (soon to be to everywhere in the city), you can go on a test drive whenever you feel like, I like to go when I'm just bored or can't figure out a hard problem. \n\nOverall the company is in a very interesting position after GM's aquisition, we are still independent as a company and very much like a startup, however backed up by a massive cooperation. I honestly can't ask for much more.\n\n\n\n",

The work you do will depend on your team, but my team gave me lots of options and many were very interesting, they definitely promote giving interns interesting work. The Bellevue office is very new and nicely decorated, it has a barista bar who makes fresh coffees, expressos, etc. \n\nThey give an option of corporate housing or $11500 (after tax, this is your take home amount) stipend which is more than enough for Bellevue.  They have lots of other interns and intern events during the summer, not sure about other terms. Theres also a monthly 100 dollars \"wellness perk\", which is just a free 100 dollars to spend on whatever you want. They also promote volunteering and have whats known as VTO (Volunteer Time Off) which interns are encouraged to take advantage of.",

The test environment broke all the time and people didn't care. I was stuck with an underpowered dev server for the first 2 months which made everything very slow and flaky. Sometimes it took weeks for people to review my code. When planning my project, one teammate kept harping on the fact that it's \"an intern project\" and \"Maybe he doesn't know how to code.\"\n\nMy manager was not a good mentor. One of the first things he told me was how his previous intern's project is no longer used in production at all. He often acted as if things could be done in a \"few hours\" or \"a day\" when it would obviously be more work than that. When I was almost done planning my project, he changed his mind and wanted part of it to work completely differently.\n\nThat being said, the food and perks and corporate housing are great. They throw a ton of cash at the intern program. It's also cool to listen to Mark at the Q\u0026A every Friday.",

You get provided housing in full ($2000 USD/month value) in Manhattan (30 minute walk, 10 minute subway), along with a $2000 USD lump sum pay for relocation. The internship program itself comes with tons of events including weekly tech talks, picnic (they rent an island), data centre tour and hackathons (overnight, 16 hr overtime) and algorithm contests. Of course, you get access to Bloomberg’s pantry, unlimited museum pass and other perks like breakfast and dinner. The building is fantastic, especially the views of uptown in Lex and downtown view in Park.\n\nWork-wise the projects were very interesting, you get to pick what you’re interested in and they try their best to do something you love. I worked with the latest technologies as well (including React/Node, Scikit-Learn, Microsoft Cognitive Services). \n\nI would recommend this internship to anyone in a heartbeat, just be careful of the team that you join.

In terms of work, I was put on a great team where my project was actually critical for the team. I became good friends with my mentor and manager, but with a company as big as Microsoft, team culture can really vary. The team asked for my preferences on the type of work I want beforehand and gave me something that matched them exactly, despite me not having any experience in that domain beforehand. However, I did find that intern expectations here were noticeably higher than the other companies I worked at. For compensation, we were also given $1200 USD for transportation (or a subsidized car rental), a few hundred for shipping things, and mad discounts on Microsoft products. The corporate housing is super nice and you don't have any roommates.",

Work hours are flexible, and you get a lot of flexibility in your own work as well.\nFrom day 1, you're treated exactly the same as full time engineers, and have the same privileges as them. The work is very impactful, and you're encouraged to come up with your own solutions to problems that they try to solve.\nThe food, location, and coworkers are all nice. They really push you to work hard and be responsible for your work, which can make you adjust your own work hours in order to get the work done.\nThe salary could be higher to match other larger companies, as they really strive to attract talented students.",

In theory a lot of companies do the same, but in practice very few actually do that. Each person I spoke to have some crazy background story, like they were homeless for a few months and then biked across the USA for charity or studied food tasting science and then decided to go into data science. That made being there really interesting, and the company tries to be very transparent and very human all around. The perks and compensation were also top-tier with a culinary team that is part of the company for the sole purpose of making healthy yet delicious food for the employees. There used to be corporate housing until they decided that interns get taxed a lot because of this, and just added it to the salary instead so now they just help you extensively look for housing.\n\n",

    "description": "I worked at Linamar in Fall 2016. My position there was really an entry level mechanical design and manufacturing position. Although the pay was extremely low (16.67/hr), the experience I got from the position really improved my co-op career. In my position, I started off with some menial officework (documentation and other paperwork), and in the 2nd month started drafting work in Solidworks. The first two months were really boring, but the exposure to Solidworks was a good formative experience. After this, I started doing far more interesting work, which involved designing fixtures for CNC machines, which included figuring out what the purpose of each part was, actually designing them, and then getting quotes for the parts and having it made. This portion of the job was a great experience and gave exposure to both the technical and business sides of things. In my opinion, YMMV depending on which facility you are in, but it does seem that this co-op position provides some good opportunity if you're willing to put some effort in. Be aware that the position is  fast paced since it is a manufacturing environment, and pretty much means you must be there from 8-5, no exceptions.",

    "description": "I was at ATS in Summer 2017, and I found it to be a worthwhile co-op. The position gave me great exposure to Solidworks modelling practices as well as good experience in mechanical design, including dimensional tolerancing and weld specification. Towards the end of my term, I was able to do some interesting static FEA work on weldments, which was certainly the highlight of my term. In my particular position, I felt that I was not given much design work until the 3rd month of the placement, which was unfortunate, but this may be different depending on the work the company has at the tine of a placement. As for the company itself, there is a cafeteria in each building with reasonably priced meals (~$7 for lunch), but no amazing perks. They do give free ice cream every payday (biweekly) and basically everyone goes for a 15min walk in the morning and afternoon around the buildings, which are a nice break from work. People are nice and hours are fairly flexible. Wish they had better coffee though lol. This is a great intermediate-senior mechanical design position, and if you pursue it,  try to ask for more and more technical work, because the company has a lot of opportunity for co-ops in that regard, if your manager is willing to give that to you.",

Needless to say, no one wanted to be the first to leave, resulting in sad kids staying WAY past their designated hours because they're all pressured to stay and pressured to not look bad for the next four grueling months.\n\nAdditionally, the office is tiny. Smaller than a classroom on the 4th floor of MC. It's as big as a 3-bedroom suite that you would find off-campus, and imagine fitting in ~20+ employees (including co-ops). The kitchen is also small enough that it's literally a fridge, a sink and a counter that fits a microwave on top. You would literally be unable to fit 3 people in the kitchen all together at one point in time. There are absolutely no perks and you are expected to work during weekends too. The only thing that the office spent their money on was probably their blinds. No amount of sunlight got in the office and added to the depressing atmosphere.\n\nFurthermore, they say that they pay the average amount according to CECA numbers. But that is for a 37.5 hour work week. They pay you biweekly, so doing the math with the hours that I had stated above, you would be earning \u003c 15/hr for work that should be worth more based on how badly the company needs it. Their product is just starting to get off the ground and it will be hell for people working here in Winter/Spring 2018. (read, stay past 6:30)\n\nSo in conclusion, do NOT come here unless you are ABSOLUTELY desperate. They hired 7 software interns and their fulltime team has 2 backend developers and 1 front-end developer. The coops had to code a majority of their backend, so you can imagine how fun it'll be to work with that. Already by the first few weeks, us group of coops were all regretting taking this offer, because literally any other company would at least let you leave before 6:30pm without feeling guilty.",

Being the only mobile developer, you're kind of alone which could be both a good and bad thing. If you've done any sort mobile development before and you're comfortable holding your own then you get to take full control of the mobile projects. On the other hand, there isn't too much mentorship on the mobile side.\n\nWe had more web apps to work on in my term so I learned a great deal about web development which was great. This openness is not just for the mobile developer but we had a full-stack developer work on an Android project so there is lots of freedom to work with technologies you're interested in learning about.\n\nThe worst part about the work is that sometimes it gets slow between projects but a lot of it is because head office slows things down and the work in the pipeline can get changed.\n\nOverall, the culture is amazing and every innovation lab should strive to have this culture and it seems you get paid more here than other companies around Communitech so it's a great place to work.",

    "description": "There are definitely some organizational pains that come with a company trying to grow. They were aggressively hiring full-time employees when I worked there for both the San Francisco and Waterloo offices, as there was an extra signing bonus for new employees going on. However, at least 5 full-time employees left the company or were fired in the 4 months I was there, so take that how you will.\n\nMost of their old monolithic application is still written in PHP, with most of the newer services written in Ruby on Rails and Golang. Mobile applications are written in Java (Android) and Objective C (iOS), although they’re planning on rewriting in Swift at some point. Some custom firmware and other things are written in C, although for the most part this is legacy or pretty stable and doesn't really need to be touched. Web stack was pretty standard. Git is used for version control. CI builds run on most of the important repositories, and backend deploys daily.\n\nI worked alongside full-times mostly on backend (although I did fix a few CSS bugs and worked a bit on Android, iOS, and the ops side of things). You'll probably ship your first PR within the first 1-2 days. They have some smart Senior developers and ops-guys (and ex-Big 4 UI/UX designers) who know what they're doing. Unfortunately, most people have only been at the company for about 2 years, and are probably out of their element in many problems you'll encounter. iOS guys are generally good considering they’re all senior, and there’s a few who know Android really well.\n\nThere's a bi-weekly Town Hall where Finances, company updates, and product direction are discussed. User metrics are always available to everyone. This flat organizational layout means that things can get bumped up the priority list if \"higher-ups\" see a bug, and they will demand that it get fixed ASAP (usually via hot-fix the day of). Some of the business decisions regarding product direction are questionable, yet nobody seems to say anything about it. However, most people are pretty chill, and lots of people hang out by the corner outside to smoke/vape or talk about games/anime/sports on Slack.\n\nA lot of the full-time employees worked 45+ hour work weeks. As a co-op, I didn't really have to deal with that, and pretty much worked 35 hours/week on average, as long as I got the work done. My manager and mentor regularly checked in with me, and they understand that you're probably there to get experience and care about your career goals. With that said, your experience will likely vary depending on your team lead, and it’s definitely not the case across all teams. According to the last co-op here, unless you put in like 50+ hours a week and implement features off the backlog “for fun”, you probably won’t be getting an Outstanding.\n\nThey do have some nice perks, including unlimited vacation days. There’s the typical tech company benefits with monthly social events, flex hours, free swag, a Christmas party, trips if the company meets their OKRs, foosball table, free pop, beer on tap (usually some craft beer), onsite massages every month, onsite gym and trainer, free snacks, 3 meals (restaurants are on a 3-4 week rotation). The food rotation is pretty sweet, and pretty much everyone goes for lunch as clockwork, which is nice. If you stay late, there usually is a dinner food order going on.",

    "description": "The experience is very team dependent here. For people working on high-profile teams like AutoPilot, which is essentially its own organization, the hours are pretty intense and there’s a lot of pressure to deliver. And when there’s a deadline approaching (like Model 3 launch), there might be some pressure there. I know one of the interns working on critical components of Model 3 was putting in upwards of 70 hours per week.\n\nThe pay isn’t the greatest in the Bay area, but you’re eligible for overtime, so most interns end up working an extra few hours here and there. Some managers aren’t about that life though, and one of my friend’s managers told him to stop working so much overtime (he was only working 3-4 hours extra per week). They’re pretty chill about hours though, and taking time off to go explore California.\n\nThere’s a few intern events that go on throughout the term, and at least one off-site event. \n\nAt DC, there’s free cereal (Happy Shapes, Crisp Rice, Raisin Bran, Corn Flakes) and drinks (soft drinks, coffee, orange juice, regular/almond/coconut milk). Some of the new offices have different cereal flavours or new drinks. There’s lunch and dinner from Rebecca Jean’s Catering that comes to around $7-12 per meal, depending on what you get. There’s also vending machines that sell food and a salad bar if you’re into that. Food trucks come by at lunchtime.\n\nOrientation happens at Fremont, regardless of whether you’re working at Fremont or DC (not too sure what happens with Gigafactory interns or Design interns). You’re supposed to have weekly 1-on-1 meetings with your mentor to go over how you’re progressing, but some totally ignore it. There’s a midterm and final evaluation that Tesla does as part of their internship program, which is available to other managers if you’re returning.\n\nCulture-wise, I’d say it’s fairly open. I found out about new products and direction pretty easily, although they’re trying to make that harder. Some projects have been becoming more secretive, which people are unhappy about.\n\nI ended up working on stuff that was actually going into the cars, and learned a lot from my mentor and the people on my team. DC is an open concept office, so most people are pretty approachable (unless you’re in the labs downstairs). I finished my project pretty quickly, and then my mentor seemed to use that to gauge my abilities to assign more interesting work afterwards. Other interns barely finished a single project, and their evaluations reflected that. Overall, I’d say the internship is what you make out of it, and if they realize that you’re doing good work, they’ll give you more interesting work to do. Some of the new hires’ abilities seem suspect, but the Senior and Staff Engineers (at least the ones I interacted with) definitely know what they’re doing.\n\nTesla uses the TN visa, so they’ll probably have you fly through YVR. A lot of full-times are Canadians! They’ll cover round trip flights and provide a $2,000 relocation bonus (after tax), and will reimburse the visa fees. Returning interns get a $1 raise which I’m not sure is negotiable, but everyone I’ve talked to wasn’t able to negotiate anything higher. This includes 8-month co-op terms. There’s the standard tech company perks like a table-tennis table, etc. There's a small on-site gym, and you're eligible for a Wageworks card that gives you $120 for UberPool/Clipper Card per month. There's also biking benefits, which nets you $5 each day you bike to work.",

    "description": "I worked there W2017. Terrible experience all around.\n\nPros\nThe developers know what they are doing\nThe tech they use is modern\n\nCons\nPretty much everything else\n\nCompany Culture\nThe company culture at Bespoke is the worst culture I have seen in a company. The full-timers are a close-knit group. They frequently make insulting remarks towards the interns and this behaviour is enabled by the group and CEO. People at the company do not understand proper workplace conduct. They are aware of this, and joke that they need HR but make no attempt to correct their behaviour.\n\nWork-Life balance\nInterns are urged to stay late, even though this is a 9 to 5 job. The CEO makes passive aggressive remarks when you leave early. This occurs even if there is no work. For a start up, it is normal to stay late and work hard, but the company culture was so terrible that no one bothered. Pro-tip, if you want interns to stay late, the trick is to make them want to stay late instead of shaming them into doing it.\n\nWork Content\nInterns often didn't have any work to do. On the team I was on, there was four interns being managed by one full-timer. He struggled to give any meaningful work to us. Often, there was no work in the backlog so we were assigned to write tests for code that he wrote. This was a failure of both management and the full-timers. The management has to ensure that there is always features that need to be developed and deployed and it is the full-timers responsibility to constantly update the backlog. None of this was done effectively. \n\nThe CEO\nMichael promotes this toxic company culture. He makes racist remarks, acts like an asshole and seems proud of the fact that no one can call out his behaviour. He has an astounding lack of self-awareness. He told the interns about the time he was working at a company and they told him to do HR training and he told them to fuck off. He also told a story about how he was competing with another white guy for a high ranking position at a company, he got in a competition with him and won, but did not get the position. He blamed it on the fact that the company management was racist. You don't think the two stories are related? I think it is likely that they didn't give him the position because he is a toxic, racist jerk that doesn't know how to interact with the people working under him.\n\nIn summary, the work is good and meaningful (when you get it). The company culture is terrible. The CEO is terrible. If you have another job on Waterloo Works, take that job instead.\n",

Since the 3D product is a fairly small team (the company at the time was also fairly small of only 60 people including sales), I got to work on everything from product management to deployments. I learned a lot and the stack they were using was really advanced and modern. As well, we had tons of team events such as cabins, cross country skiing, drinking + video/board games, curling etc. Overall it was a great time!\n\nNote: the food was amazing, definitely better than that of many company in the bay area.

I'd say that this experience was one of the best work experiences I've had so far. \n\nFrom a technical/educational perspective, I worked with Java Spring on the back end team. When I first started I was given the right resources to get myself set up and familiarised with the code base. My teammates were highly experienced in the field but were also very helpful and approachable. I first started off with some simple tasks, but as time progressed I got assignments that were as important as any other full time developer's. One of the best educational advantages was that I had top tier programmers reviewing my PRs and giving comments/suggestions on how to improve my code. There is also plenty of opportunity to work on side projects through out the term. I had the chance to work on one of them and in the process gained practical experience with Angular, Node, and MongoDB. Different projects use different tech stacks, so there's room to learn a lot (including Machine Learning).\n\nFrom a non-technical perspective, I met dozens of enthusiastic and laid-back people. Everyone knew how to have fun and understood that work isn't all about pushing out code. There was a ping pong table in the area where anyone could set up and play at any time. There were also free refreshments in the kitchen and almost always someone that was willing to sit down and just talk for a bit. Capco is well known for having one of the best work place cultures and after working there I can completely agree.\n\nOverall, working at Capco was great for both learning new things and making great connections. I'd definitely recommend working there.",

They have an office in Downtown Vancouver (15 mins away from \"Big Park,\" the other MSFT office)\n\nWORK:\n\nGame development is hectic and haphazard, and unfortunately, I came in during a particularly busy time for my team. I didn't really have a chance to sit down with someone and \"learn the ropes,\" and I was instead thrust head-first into a task and told to \"figure it out.\" \nNow, Unreal Engine 4 is a BEAST, and is not something that easily lends itself to \"self learning.\" Pile-on all of the game-specific things you need to know, getting started in the codebase was incredibly difficult... \n\nRegardless, one of the (few) nice things about the \"diving in head first\" method of learning a codebase is that after you thrash around a bunch, you eventually get pretty good at figuring things out yourself! By then end of the term, I wrote code fairly quickly, and learned a bunch of invaluable skills in terms of navigating my way around a gargantuan C++ codebase.\n\nLIFE:\n\nThis was the real highlight of the internship :D\n\n1) I supremely lucked out with my team. The Audio Team at the coalition were some of the coolest and nicest people i've had the pleasure of working with. They really made the day interesting, and banter was always on-point. DISCLAIMER: i've heard from other interns that other teams were not as good, so YMMV\n2) The Coalition has a super laid-back culture, with free beer and snacks every-other Friday\n3) The intern-group I had was awesome, and made after-work events and weekends a ton of fun\n4) Vancouver is a really awesome place to live. There is a ton to do, both within the city, and in the surrounding cities. There are lots of really cool hikes (if you're into that!)\n\nMISC:\n\n- Microsoft doesn't set you up with housing, which is annoying :( I was lucky enough to live with a friend from Vancouver, so his parents scouted out the place first, but otherwise you'd have to go in blind\n- Housing is bloody expensive in downtown (I paid 1500/mo for a queen-size bed in a closet)\n- The 5800 salary = 4400/mo base + 5000/term housing stipend + misc bonus monies\n\nTL;DR: It was a pretty good time!\n\nLearned a lot, and had a lot of fun doing it.\n8.5/10 would intern again.",

The internship program is fairly well structured and they try their best to provide meaningful mentors, but it does depend a bit on personality types. To me, Redfin is the perfect size for a company - large enough to give comfortable compensation and in house infrastructure, while small enough such there are plenty of opportunities for an intern to impact the larger organization.

    "description": "As mentioned in other reviews, Microsoft is the biggest software company in the world and your internship experience varies drastically depending on what team you are assigned.\nI would like to emphasize the compensation in this review. Microsoft literally makes it rain for interns. For first time Microsoft interns (not explorer), you will get paid $7200 per month (per tax). If you were to return to Microsoft as an intern, your salary will get bumped to $7650 and you will receive a one-time bonus of $5000. On top of the base salary and bonus, you can either choose to live in a corporate housing (hella fancy one, with bi-weekly cleaning service) or a one-time $9000 housing stipend for your 4-month internship. So if you are a returning Microsoft intern, who chooses the $9000 housing stipend, your total compensation for the internship would be close to $45k USD (equivalent $135k annual salary). In addition, Washington state (where Microsoft headquarter resides) does not collect state tax, so you would definitely get more money in your paycheque than your cali friends.\nLast but not least, Microsoft also provides rental car program to interns. Basically, you can rent a car from a Micorosft-partnered car rental company with a subsidized price of ~$700 a month (Insurance and toll included). Having a car is blessed because you don't have to wait for the bus / uber everywhere.\nIn conclusion, I am so thankful that Microsoft really takes care of their interns money-wise and I would highly recommend Microsoft if you wanna cash out.",

There's always an excess of stuff to do on the Data team; things like building ETLs tasks on Airflow to developing ML models. People from other teams were extremely open for you to book a meeting room and then teaching you all about the stuff they're working on, it's a great way to develop skills for a specific field if that's what you're into.\n\nThe on-site gym is not the best, but it gets the job done (no bench press or squat rack, just a smith machine, treadmills, free weights, and some machines). There's a lot of variety with the snacks, and drinks. In the lobby, there's a $20,000 espresso machine where you could make the best coffee you'll ever have (after taking a barista course).

That being said, the applications that I worked on were very internal to RBC and not sure if they were too useful. I mainly worked on UI features, and bug fixes from time to time. There were definitely lots of times where I did not really have anything to do, and I'd just play games on my laptop or left early. My team was very small, one other co-op (which was nice considering how boring lunches would have been alone), one lead developer, and a project manager who was non-technical really. I'd say its a decent first co-op, no fancy perks or anything, but there were always events going on since I interned in the summer and they usually had free food and stuff at the events.",

Take the mentorship/w-l balance/meaningful work/overall rating with a grain of salt; this is not indicative of the entire company, but rather to my one experience.\n\nSometimes the work gets a little dry and it's not the most interesting, but honestly, that's what you get when you ask to be treated like a full-time employee; you do everything which includes features, tech debt cleanup, tests, documentation, etc.\n\nThere are some really smart people at the company and they run different groups/workshops (such as a Ruby monthly group and a Frontend monthly group) where they discuss best practices for those technologies and how they're used across different teams at Square. Square has a lot of engineers working on open source projects, eg. okHTTP, Ember.js, Decaffeinate, etc. \n\nThere are lots of groups for other activities such as sports groups, different cultural groups, acapella, board games, movies, bubble tea, etc.\n\nIn terms of perks, you'll get a housing stipend (depending on term it'll be either a $2000 stipend or corporate housing, though corporate housing is extremely rare now). This brings total comp up to around $9000/month.\n\nFor food, breakfast/dinner is completely free. For lunch, you pay $10, and then get it reimbursed on your paycheck (so you have to pay income tax on the reimbursement). After 90 days, interns can elect to receive benefits (eg. medical/vision/dental, health plans, transportation plans) or opt out and get a flat taxable fringe benefit added to your paycheck.",

As an iOS developer, I learned way more than I expected to learn. The other iOS developers (and even the android and API guys) are incredibly smart and they teach you a lot. Two of the iOS developers work remote so you have to be pretty comfortable using Skype and other communication tools, which also means you have to be able to work well independently. The plus side is they're open to you working from home or from another office when you need to.\n\nThe work environment is really relaxed and there are hardly days where you're bored out of your mind or you're swamped with so much work that you have to work weekends. So the work/life balance is fantastic.\n\nThe work environment is also not super trendy. You'll find a foosball table but you won't get perks like free swag, free daily food (there are days with free food though), couches, bean bag chairs, beer on tap, etc. Additionally, Ceridian ships enterprise code and recently went public so they're fairly big. That can be seen as both a pro and a con.\n\nIf you're okay without those fancy perks (that really do nothing in the long run), and want to ship good code, this is a great place to work and guaranteed you will learn a lot and your code quality will improve a ton. If you care more about the perks, you're better off going to a startup or somewhere in Cali.",

    "description": "Pros:\n- Great mentorship and work-life balance. \n- Flexible hours and work from home policy\n- Treated as full time member of team, with an equal say in team decisions\n- Teams have a very large amount of autonomy, supporting different working styles. Some teams are very autonomous, while others rely heavily on pairing. Many teams are split across offices.\n- Interns can lead Failure Friday, and motivated interns can go on-call for their team\n- Functional programming is applied very widely; Many teams have most of their code in either Elixir or Scala, with only legacy code in Ruby\n- Free lunch\n- The people are very accommodating to different backgrounds and lifestyles. [Daddy|Mommy]Duty, for example, is a common term for when you adjust your work schedule so that you can take care of your kid. There are also various support groups within the company, like SisterDity and VeteranDuty. PD doesn't use \"culture fit\" as an excuse to exclude people, like some other bay-area companies do.\n\nCons:\n- Some teams work mostly in (an exceptionally old version of) Ruby on Rails. \n- General growing pains as the company grows\n\nI have worked in both offices. I would highly recommend anyone to intern at PD, but make sure you talk to a previous intern on your team to make sure it is a good fit. The Toronto office is better in every respect except weather and pay, with a more laid-back culture and better free lunch.\n\nThe lunch is exceptional. There was a wide variety of food from many different vendors each day. If you are in the Toronto office, I highly recommend Spicy Ethiopian day. In SF, deep dish pizza.\n\nPD hires people from a wide variety of backgrounds, which is great. If you can code but you aren't in CS or Software Engineering, don't let that stop you from applying.\n\nI would also recommend asking about their policies on affirmative action if that is something that is important to you. \n\nQuestions to ask your team if you get an offer:\n- What tools does the team use?\n- How much time is usually spent in meetings? How much of the time is spent working on new services and features, vs. polishing existing ones? Ops work vs. coding?\n\n",

To start with, Ubisoft has a very thorough onboarding process as well as an awesome mentorship program that makes sure all newbies get a quick start on the project and take on whatever task that interests them the most, so I was able to understand the scope of the game and catch up with the development in the very first week. As a rendering programmer, I worked on lighting and post-fx features concerning cutting-edge techniques in computer graphics, which was fun and challenging since I had to read tons of papers before even starting to write a single line of code. I was also treated as a full-time employee and given full ownership of the features I worked on, meaning that I had to communicate extensively with artists and technical directors about the features, and was solely responsible for whatever issue that popped up. Work-life balance was pretty good as there's no overwork unless a deadline is approaching. Overall, 10/10 would recommend to anyone passionate about gaming and curious about how video games are developed.

Everyone was open at any time to help, and we had weekly 1on1s to make sure everything is going well. My mentor was super knowledgeable about many topics, and it was really cool getting to know him and staying in touch in the future.\n\nWork life balance is great, the working hours are flexible and occasional WFH is also allowed.\n\nThe company itself is also awesome, weekly town halls with the whole company to discuss goals, progress etc. Biannual overnight trips with the whole team. Free Goodlife membership and TTC metropass. Tons of snacks and drinks in office. Weekly lunch. Occasional team lunches and company outings.\n\nBecause of all of this I really looked forward to coming to work every day. Loved getting work done and learning while also having fun with the team. Definitely recommend it",

I also had weekly formal oral feedback and bi-weekly written feedback from mentor. However, YMMV depends on what team you are on, but most of them are very good and have meaningful work. In terms of intern events, they literally have multiple events every week to do stuff like hiking, cruising, kayaking, glass fusing, bubble soccer, to name just a few, so there were lots of fun. Besides, their cafeteria is the best in bay area. (Any contenders?) BTW, corporate housing was 2 people in one bedroom (not as good as FB) but was very close to Dropbox.

Instead of working in a bright, modern, open office, I worked in a claustrophobic, depressing sea of cubicles. \n- The manager who hired me was transferred right before I arrived, which meant no-one on the team really knew what I was supposed to be doing. I eventually worked on a project spearheaded by the team's former manager, but without him giving guidance and direction, the project stalled, taking nearly the entire term to finish.\n- My team was incredibly antisocial, not just with me, but amongst themselves. Lunches were quiet, with no-one being able to start and sustain conversations. Laughter came in short bursts, with long stretches of silence in between.\n\nThat said, the area was quite nice, with the housing being pretty decent (shared-room, but I lived with someone I knew, so it wasn't that bad). If you can get a group of friends together, there is lots of stuff to do on the weekends in and around the bay-area (not in Cupertino itself though, it's really boring)",

    "description": "I interned here as a SWE intern. Work was really good and my team gave me a lot of autonomy on what I could work on. The company is huge but every org works pretty autonomously so I didn't feel like I was doing unimpactful work. Everything is extremely team dependent.\n\nApple Park is one of the most beautiful buildings I've seen in my entire life and they've recently opened it to all Apple employees. The facilities, gyms, etc are all top notch and in pristine condition and exactly what you would expect from Apple. \n\nFrom my experience, at Apple you'll get a shared private office with another co-worker. IMO it's way better than the crowded open office layout all the other tech companies have. YMMV though, some (unlucky) people have cubes.\n\nEngineering orgs get free snacks/drinks but YMMV. \n\nCaffe Macs food is amazing, it's way better than the food they serve at Google but you have to pay a subsidized cost for it. The food quality is probably comparable to LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. \n\nBreakfast costs $2 (Avocado toast with half an avocado) or $3 (Acai bowl). There are other options like omelettes and breakfast burritos but it depends on which office you get placed in. Lunch costs between $5 (for an unlimited topping sandwich) and $12 (Scallops, Oysters, etc). Pizzas are $8 and are really good. Engineers get a $12 dinner credit past 7pm. \n\nPay seems a bit off in all of these postings for some reason. My guess is that hardware/embedded/low-level SW roles are paying less than pure SW roles. I got paid 38/hr ($6600/month) + free corporate housing but I was really early in my co-op terms. You get paid by the hour and (with manager approval), you can work OT for 1.5x the pay. You can get around $42/hr ($7280/month) if you're slightly more senior. \n\nCorporate housing is a really nice 2BR place. They do stuff 4 people in that 2BR place though. This is pretty common, its done the same way in LinkedIn too. If you don't like having a roommate, I'd advise taking the $1000 post-tax housing stipend and finding your place around the Sunnyvale area (you can find a private room for ~1200 on PadPiper). \n\nInterns get access to Apple's Employee Purchase Program for substantial discounts on Apple products, both for yourself and for your friends \u0026 family.\n\nApple's University Relations team basically doesn't host any intern events other than in the summer, but even then, there aren't that many of them and they're way too large scale since Apple hires so many interns. Orientation is only for half a day, so don't count on meeting many other interns during your internship unless you really make an effort to. ",

I felt very fortunate to work on something that made an actual impact in the company which made it not feel like the typical intern role.

    "description": "\"When you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags\"\n\nWhen you're working somewhere, it's often easy to get used to your surroundings and not notice anything wrong. I thought that my time at Bespoke Metrics was average, until I went to other companies to work and realized the smoldering dumpster of a workplace that this was.  \n\nInternships should be an investment that companies make so that there are hopes that the interns will convert to a full-time employee that will require less training to get started. This is why Silicon Valley and top tech companies pay their interns an exorbitant amount of money to hire them, even though the company won't make that money back from the intern's work.\n\nHowever, Bespoke Metrics hire interns because their core product requires cheap labour and what better way to get this than to hire poor students and then use the workterm evaluation as a \"carrot on the stick\" to overwork them?\n\nIn my term here, there were many serious issues with the full-time team. Some of the people are nice (4/13), but all the people who held key positions high up were the most arrogant and tactless people that I have ever met. You can read the other reviews to see the things that certain people have said, as that topic can be itself another review.\n\nAlso, if everyone in the company and their mother is a \"senior X\" does that \"senior\" keyword even matter? It literally becomes a label to inflate your ego, and it clearly has gotten to the heads of the people working here.\n\nThe work here was also really spotty. You can either be nuked with work, often a deliverable due by the end of the day or you would literally have nothing to do even if you ask your manager (I was told to 'read up on best practices' of certain libraries MULTIPLE times throughout the term). \n\nThe work culture here is perfectly represented as waterboarding. Everyday is a fun game of Russian Roulette where your personal physical + mental health is on the line and the bullet is a truckload of work due before you are allowed to leave. Hours are insane when you are required to finish the work because the company needs this functionality to make money.\n\nAlso, as mentioned by someone else, they pay you biweekly, so you're doing volunteer work if you stay past 9-5, but you can't leave or else they will passive-aggressively comment on you 'leaving early'.\n\nBack to the spotty work. I cannot imagine the time that I have wasted just waiting for time to pass. I started reading CTCI, fueled by the motivation of getting as far away from here as possible and ended up getting better jobs. I would say that this job is like that abusive cheating ex that you learn what to look out for in future relationships, but made your everyday life a living hell when you were with them.\n\nAlso, the management team comes from Finance backgrounds. This means that they bring the toxic \"time at work \u003e everything else\" mentality that you find in Finance/Big 4 firms, which is insane. You have interns that are blackmailed and guilted to start work early, stay late, while often doing nothing. I sometimes wondered if this is what jail time looked like while working here. \n\nThere have literally been times when the interns would play games together during work hours because they have no work and have asked if they can leave early for the day, get denied and then resort to doing something beside photosynthesize. Funny enough, the fulltimes would drop their work to watch. This raises a few key questions:\n\n1. If the interns have 0 work and are playing games, why can't they leave? It's literally wasting everybody's time and adds to the electricity bill for a poor little startup.\n2. If the fulltimes are just watching, is there no work that needs to be done? It's startup, there is always work. It's just that the engineers aren't doing their jobs and pulling in more work for the interns to do. I believe that work \u003e no work, but there's no work and no one is trying to fix that.\n3. Did we sign a job offer or a prison sentence? I'm locked up in a tiny and poorly lit room with a bunch of other horribly depressed people while being berated by management who literally would pace around to watch what we were doing.\n\nManagement, if you really do care about the interns, which I honestly doubt, I would start changing the way you treat them. There was legitimate harassment and bullying that happened to an intern during my term and they got depressed because they had to put up with this for 4 months. We aren't monkeys for you to play with or robots that idle until your next command. Please show just the normal amount of respect that you would show to someone else. Please grow up.",

At least for the Siri organization. I was paid $45 USD/hour with the chance to do basically unlimited overtime (1.5x hourly).\n\nMentorship was excellent - of course this is team based - my mentor constantly checked up on me to ensure that we were in sync and that I was having an enjoyable experience.\n\nPeople were incredibly friendly in my organization. Although you have to pay for lunch (dinner is free), the food is really good.\n\nOn site gym at Apple Park is really nice and your corporate housing will be right beside the campus so it's a 5 minute walk to go to the gym.\n\nAll in all, a great place to work on the software side. I do hear on the hardware/product design and EPM side hours are longer, but don't know enough details about those teams.\n\nIn terms of other benefits you get:\n- 15% for friends and family on Apple products\n- 25% for personal use on Apple products\n- $500 off an Apple product at the fourth month of your internship\n- A bunch of other discounts for third party products",

    "description": "TLDR: Awesome experience, great company culture, full ownership over projects, good modern tech stack with lots to learn, competitive pay (especially for earlier coop terms), perfect WLB and great mentorship. I would highly recommend this position if you are self-motivated and passionate about full stack web development.\n\nAwesome opportunity to learn about all aspects of full stack web development, since there are only two full stack developer co-ops you will have full control over your projects, from ideation to development to deployment. There can be some downtime between projects, however if you take initiative and find problems to solve, you are more than encouraged to innovate new solutions for them. The projects solve real problems that LCBO faces, so your work will very likely go into production and have real users after completion.\n\nAnother great thing is the amount of freedom you have in your role, for example, the UI/UX designer on my term wanted to learn frontend development, whereas I spent my focus on backend and devops work and the other full stack spent some time on data science work. In terms of development, the tech stack is pretty widespread and modern, focused on the MERN stack for building web apps with supporting tools such as Elasticsearch, Redis and Docker, however we were highly encouraged to introduce new technologies if they see fit.\n\nCompany culture is amazing, the innovation lead and technology lead are both extremely chill and fun to be around. WLB is great, no pressure to deliver products fast, however you can accomplish a lot if you are motivated to do so. We did monthly team events on the last Friday of each month (VR, Escape Rooms), although they aren’t covered by the company, the high pay makes up for it. Mentorship used to be a problem in past terms, however a technical technology lead was hired in my term who providing us with technical help when we needed it.",

I would not touch this place with a 10 foot pole and a hazmat suit because it's absolutely toxic.\n\nFirst of all, you *will* get roasted by your manager, in front of everyone on your team during meetings. Everyone goes through this. You will get roasted for the most trivial of things, such as forgetting to update your tickets.\n\nSecond, this place is straight up corporate. Useless bureaucracy everywhere. Enterprise grade micromanagement. The team operates on waterfall. Virtually every piece of code you write (including bugfixes) requires you to write a big ass design document with a 20 page template, and you need to get that reviewed and approved by the team *before* *you* *can* *write* *any* *code*. After that's done, you have to provide detailed end dates for every task in your project. God forbid you miss one of those deadlines, because you're in for a roasting. We all know how good the software engineering industry in general is at estimating deadlines...\n\nDuring your project, you have to provide constant email updates about the status of your project. Micromanagement nuff said. Forget an update? You're in for a roasting.\n\nWhat's good? The people on the team tend to be smart, nice, and pleasant individuals to work with. Unfortunately the culture set by the leaders is straight out of office space.",

Mentorship to me means being able to push me in the right direction when I am stuck, and at the same time encouraging me to figure out something on my own. This internship taught me how to be independent. I learned how to actually navigate source code in a large repository and understand code that I did not write. By far one of the best companies that I have interned at, in terms of becoming a better software engineer. Mozilla also flew everyone in the company to San Francisco for a work week, and we were exposed to different Mozilla products (e.g. Firefox, Rust, WebAssembly, AR/VR, etc.). Interns were also given a MacBook Pro 15\" (latest model) to take home after the internship. This is one of the best places to intern at if you are really into the web and open source (+ a lot of swags and stickers). They have a ton of people on the W3C team, if that excites you. Salary is based on your location and education (Degree, Masters/PhD). It is the same for everyone in the same category.",
