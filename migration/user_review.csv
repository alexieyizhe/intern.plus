17,true,"Microsoft Japan is unlike any other internship experience and obviously that is mostly because of the location. I'm going to list out the pros and cons for this internship in detail since there are not many international students who intern here.

Pros: 
1. It's in Tokyo! Their office is in shinagawa and its so easy to get to any place in Tokyo. Weekends and evenings are always so fun. This is the main reason I give it a 5 star. If traveling or living in Tokyo for 4 months doesn't excite you then maybe this isn't the internship for you.
2. They put you up in a nice studio apartment close to shinagawa. For me, my apartment was in Tamachi station but I heard some people were in a different location. Either way it is paid for and pretty nice. It's a little small but definitely enough for one person. 
3. The Japan team only hires international interns on the office team and the office team in Japan unlike Redmond is very small. They only have the Sway and Docs.com team and a bit of Office Lens I believe. This is a pro and a con. It's a pro because you get to know the team. It's very open concept unlike Microsoft in general. The con is that you might not want to work on these products at all. 
4. Companies in Japan have a interesting culture. People there work reallllly late but this isn't true for Microsoft Japan. I mean people did work late but I never felt any pressure to do so. It would be like any other company in Silicon Valley etc. 

Cons:
1. Salary. You will not save any money if you come here. If you're using your internships to pay for school then re evaluate this internship. We got paid around 2.5 CAD before tax/health insurance. They do reimburse you for the flights though. I heard that the the term after us started getting paid 400000 yen which is about 4000 CAD (at least when I interned there). But even then Japan is an expensive place and if you want to travel and eat good food this money will be enough to live there but not to save and bring back.
2. Language barrier. Fewer people than I expected spoke English in Tokyo. Get used to using google translate or learn some Japanese. This can sometimes be frustrating because buying milk can be difficult but at the same time if you're considering this then I assume you have some interest in learning about the culture and language.

86,true,"I worked in the Boutros Lab at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research during the Summer of 2015. This was a research lab which applied machine learning techniques to cancer research. The lab actively participates in machine learning competitions related to bioinformatics such as the DREAM challenges (as it is similar to the work done in the lab and it can improve your skill with similar datasets).

As a software engineer here I got to work on both machine learning competitions and software engineering work. For the machine learning competitions I cleaned and transformed data in R, then ran it through the pipeline of feature selection and extraction, then the actual algorithms, then maybe some stacking. The software engineering work was pretty standard and related to maintaining and improving the libraries that are in use by the lab. At the time of my internship the codebase was R (for science related tasks) and perl (for systems related tasks). There are some libraries which have grown convoluted over the years being written as one-off research code which then is hacked to be reused. As a software engineering intern I had to refactor some of this spaghetti code.

Every week there was a lab meeting where there was one small and one large presentation by lab members. This was interesting to me as I got to learn about the different projects people had and how they used different ML models in order to make sense of the biological data. Sometimes it was very biology heavy which did offset me from understanding what they were presenting.

The lab members were very friendly and helpful, being experienced in their respective fields of expertise. Usually there are also other interns doing either similar software engineering work or bioinformatics research. Most of the full time lab members are bioinformaticians with a handful of software engineers which was kind of intimidating since I don't know much biology so I feared talking to the bioinformaticians (which was probably a mistake as they are strong programmers for academic work, which has different priorities but nonetheless they probably know many tricks that I could have learnt, especially with manipulating data in R).

The lab is in downtown Toronto right next to a subway station and there is a food court at the bottom of the building with ~10 selections. Exiting the building there are many great food places just a 5-10 minutes walk away.

The work experience might vary depending on the team, but YIP (Yelp Internship Program) does an amazing job at engaging interns with activities at least once a week (e.g. street art painting, indoor mini golf, Giant's game with the mentor, trip to Angel Island, just to name a few). I participated in most of them and it was a great way to get to know the other interns and explore the city.

I enjoyed the work; it' was not a 'let's add this small feature on the internal tools', but actually directly working on the Yelp platform. One drawback for me was that my mentor was leading a big project and had a lot of responsibilities when I started my internship. I wished I received more guidance / mentorship throughout the term.",7360,"USD","monthly","Yelp",58,,213,4,3,5,5

I was assigned a team and given a designated mentor. I wasn't really given many options to branch out into what I was interested in. I worked mostly modifying internal API responses to facilitate the building of a few smaller features. The main feature I worked on wasn't particularly that complex or interesting; hence, the low rating for the quality of work.  Work-life balance was essentially enforced for interns, since interns are paid hourly and overtime is discouraged.

The culture there isn't great for interns, because corporate full-times tend to look down on you because you're a student. I worked with programmers so there was none of that, but it showed with the university management. There's a lot of office politics which made everything 1000x more complicated, and the lack of proper management made everyone's work excessively harder. Also the pay was incredibly low while nothing except the visa was subsidized, which was almost not because they didn't know we had to pay another fee when we pick it up. HR rejected to pay it until the full-times talked to finance and clarified that it's supposed to be paid.

The program is pretty structured. You do 3-5 self-contained small-ish projects, each one with a different mentor. Each one is interesting, takes a few weeks, and are often in a variety of different areas, which is nice. You don't get the same experience as a full time employee working on a team though.

If I was forced to find cons it would be the intern sandbox and the corporate IT setup. Interns are heavily firewalled with little access to the intranet and internal data, which is a bit sad since you can't actually see the things you make running in production. Also you need to use a CentOS computer without root access, the IT people are helpful and can install things for you, but only from the sparse and outdated CentOS repos. They have good reasons for both of these, but it doesn't stop them from being minor annoyances. You also have to do all your work on a remote server (but with sub-millisecond ping and gigabit bandwidth), which makes GUI editors like Sublime Text harder to use.

271,false,"I recently applied for the position of an intern as a software developer and after a rigorous interview process got selected. Here is my interview experience in brief:
The whole interview was classified into 4 rounds.

Round 0: It was an online contest hosted on Hackerrank(90 mins). There were 3 questions, one was string based(medium), the second was a dynamic programming(easy), and third was a dynamic programming(medium hard). Doing one problem was enough, though it depends on the actual rank list and not the number of problems you solve. This was followed by a debug round, a question on binary exponentiation. We just had to correct the code and submit within 15 mins.

Round 1: This was a GoToMeeting interview. The interview was all about your resume. The interviewer asked about the projects in detail for about 30 mins and then in general everything about your experience with past internships and stuff.

Round 2: This was an online coding round. I was given a question on binary trees, had to find the maximum sum path in the tree and code it up within 40 mins. The interviewer expects you to go step by step in this round, that is first you give a brute force solution and then progressively try to decrease the time complexity until the interviewer is satisfied. (Tip: Don't jump to the answer directly even if you know the answer beforehand. They are not interested in the fact that you know a problem but they test your approach to a new problem.)This was followed by a general discussion about the resume again.

Round 3: This was a problem design round, basically to check how you go about solving a problem and how much of your computer science concepts are clear. Firstly, the interviewer presented a problem about recommendations made on an online e-commerce website. I had to suggest how all this could have been done. Another question was to design a bot that wished your facebook friends automatically. Another question was about distributed systems, he posted a query which needed to be parallelized, and you had to discuss all the aspects of it. Basically what the interviewer was looking for was that you understand your solution inside out and know about all of its shortcomings that may occur and then he would ask you to somehow solve these shortcomings.

This was all about it. It was a great experience interviewing with Codenation. Note that interviewing opportunity can only be obtained by participating in the Codeagon contest conducted by Codenation. I think you need to be in the top 100 or so for getting to interview. This first process may vary a little depending on a lot of things. So keep your eye on their facebook page for the update.

All in all, I was quite disappointed with the internship. Why did they hire me if they didn't have any projects to put me on? I didn't learn much other than some high level architecture stuff.

Cons: Kik is a small company and has monolithic Facebook as it's main competitor, so it has a lot to prove with few people.

A lot of the founders and upper management seem to have drank the Kool-Aid and think they're the greatest thing since sliced bread. There's also a structural disconnect between the two offices (Waterloo and Bangalore), where the culture of the Indian office seems to clash with the culture at the local office—one of the teams I encountered during my time there measured the state of a project by ""how many lines of code remaining to write"", which is a totally useless metric and given as an estimate at the start of the project.

Their technology is somewhat dated, although it varies by team. A lot of the company used an old VCS (IBM ClearCase), although they were beginning to transition to their own hosted Gitlab instance. Also, they have a lot of their testing infrastructure written in a rather esoteric language that nobody really seems to use anymore—Tcl. Java, C and C++ make up a majority of the rest of their codebase, although they were beginning to embrace newer technologies like Golang (for some newer services) and node.js (mostly for client-facing things). I think some teams use Python as well.

I worked on the Subscriber Policy Broker (SPB) team, and the project I was given was pretty isolated from the rest of the team.

Cons:
- Some Corporate BS: There are times where LCBO's corporate machine clashes with the fast pace of innovation. Eg: we were once blocked on a project for several weeks due to internal bureaucracy in getting access to some internal data.

Didn't get any busy work after the first few weeks, was actually given meaningful work that taught me important software development practices and more. My boss specifically took me aside at times to highlight important things both about my work and thriving in a corporate environment. Team were all super friendly and helpful.

Positive outlook on the company as a whole. Work life balance is there as most of the company is just people looking to do their ~40 hours and enjoy life outside of work. The occasional weekend of overtime would be asked in order to hit a target date but this seemed to be a very infrequent thing. Cool product and the company looks to be heading in the right direction.

A few footnotes:

1. Company is aging. Ciena Ottawa is a lot of former Nortel employees, and the company really didn't hit their stride until recently. This has created a bit of a hiring gap where you have a lot of employees aged 40+ but very few in the late twenties/early thirties area. They've been hiring a lot of new grads so there is definitely youth there.
2. Canadian pay. You can see their fulltime numbers easy enough on glassdoor and it's nothing exceptional as far as Canadian software goes. They have decent perks for employees who have stuck with the company for a bit, and I get the vibe that this is a ""work here for potentially the rest of your life"" kind of place. Having experienced both this environment and the much faster paced, swap companies frequently, higher paid environment of the states, I am not sure which I prefer. Two completely different paths which I believe both have their benefits.

434,true,"3rd month into the term, experience has been nothing short of amazing. Super exciting to work at one of the best self driving car company in the world right now, I worked in a very small team (a special feature) of 2 people, I basically owned the entire feature stack, my work involved everything from frontend, backend, server scalability, data pipeline to the autonomous vehicle stack on the car. To put it simply, I learned a shit load.

Work is very meaningful and relevant, company is evaluated by milestone, therefore everything I worked on was purely towards the milestones, and the impact of my work is clearly visible from metrics and benchmarks. 

Company is growing extremely rapidly, we have about 300 full time right now, though the managements are doing a great job aligning the focus, especially the CEO who is also super down to earth and friendly. However as a consequence it can be difficult to get help just because the pace of the company's growth, it sometimes take a couple of redirecting to get to the right person. If you can self learn quickly then it isn't a problem.

The company is actively pushing equality and healthy work culture *cough cough uber*, there are 15 interns this summer, the intern program is new but also well planned, lots of intern events. The expectations of interns are just about the same as full time, still the workload is very resonable, and the work hours are very flexible. 

Lots of benefits: free breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, deductable commute, free self driving car ride to work (soon to be to everywhere in the city), you can go on a test drive whenever you feel like, I like to go when I'm just bored or can't figure out a hard problem. 

Overall the company is in a very interesting position after GM's aquisition, we are still independent as a company and very much like a startup, however backed up by a massive cooperation. I honestly can't ask for much more.

Highlight: They really care about your mentorship and you as a person in all aspects!

I worked on the iOS team without any previous experience in mobile at all, and everyone I spoke to made it very clear that doing something that you don't have experience in is completely and totally fine - and actually encouraged. In theory a lot of companies do the same, but in practice very few actually do that. Each person I spoke to have some crazy background story, like they were homeless for a few months and then biked across the USA for charity or studied food tasting science and then decided to go into data science. That made being there really interesting, and the company tries to be very transparent and very human all around. The perks and compensation were also top-tier with a culinary team that is part of the company for the sole purpose of making healthy yet delicious food for the employees. There used to be corporate housing until they decided that interns get taxed a lot because of this, and just added it to the salary instead so now they just help you extensively look for housing.

Although the pay was extremely low (16.67/hr), the experience I got from the position really improved my co-op career. In my position, I started off with some menial officework (documentation and other paperwork), and in the 2nd month started drafting work in Solidworks. The first two months were really boring, but the exposure to Solidworks was a good formative experience. After this, I started doing far more interesting work, which involved designing fixtures for CNC machines, which included figuring out what the purpose of each part was, actually designing them, and then getting quotes for the parts and having it made. This portion of the job was a great experience and gave exposure to both the technical and business sides of things. In my opinion, YMMV depending on which facility you are in, but it does seem that this co-op position provides some good opportunity if you're willing to put some effort in.

720,true,"do NOT work here.

First of all, they pressure you to come to work early and stay late. On the contract and in the interviews, they say that it's a 9-5 job, but realistically, it's at least 8:30-6:30. To give you an idea, one of the coops left at 5:30 in the first week and got called out by the CEO who happened to be by the door. We weren't even doing anything that first week other than some warmup coding exercises. Needless to say, no one wanted to be the first to leave, resulting in sad kids staying WAY past their designated hours because they're all pressured to stay and pressured to not look bad for the next four grueling months.

Additionally, the office is tiny. Smaller than a classroom on the 4th floor of MC. It's as big as a 3-bedroom suite that you would find off-campus, and imagine fitting in ~20+ employees (including co-ops). The kitchen is also small enough that it's literally a fridge, a sink and a counter that fits a microwave on top. You would literally be unable to fit 3 people in the kitchen all together at one point in time. There are absolutely no perks and you are expected to work during weekends too. The only thing that the office spent their money on was probably their blinds. No amount of sunlight got in the office and added to the depressing atmosphere.

Furthermore, they say that they pay the average amount according to CECA numbers. But that is for a 37.5 hour work week. They pay you biweekly, so doing the math with the hours that I had stated above, you would be earning < 15/hr for work that should be worth more based on how badly the company needs it. Their product is just starting to get off the ground and it will be hell for people working here in Winter/Spring 2018. (read, stay past 6:30)

So in conclusion, do NOT come here unless you are ABSOLUTELY desperate. They hired 7 software interns and their fulltime team has 2 backend developers and 1 front-end developer. The coops had to code a majority of their backend, so you can imagine how fun it'll be to work with that.

This openness is not just for the mobile developer but we had a full-stack developer work on an Android project so there is lots of freedom to work with technologies you're interested in learning about.

The worst part about the work is that sometimes it gets slow between projects but a lot of it is because head office slows things down and the work in the pipeline can get changed.

Most of their old monolithic application is still written in PHP, with most of the newer services written in Ruby on Rails and Golang. Mobile applications are written in Java (Android) and Objective C (iOS), although they’re planning on rewriting in Swift at some point. Some custom firmware and other things are written in C, although for the most part this is legacy or pretty stable and doesn't really need to be touched. Web stack was pretty standard.

I worked alongside full-times mostly on backend (although I did fix a few CSS bugs and worked a bit on Android, iOS, and the ops side of things). You'll probably ship your first PR within the first 1-2 days. They have some smart Senior developers and ops-guys (and ex-Big 4 UI/UX designers) who know what they're doing. Unfortunately, most people have only been at the company for about 2 years, and are probably out of their element in many problems you'll encounter. iOS guys are generally good considering they’re all senior, and there’s a few who know Android really well.

There's a bi-weekly Town Hall where Finances, company updates, and product direction are discussed. User metrics are always available to everyone. This flat organizational layout means that things can get bumped up the priority list if ""higher-ups"" see a bug, and they will demand that it get fixed ASAP (usually via hot-fix the day of). Some of the business decisions regarding product direction are questionable, yet nobody seems to say anything about it. However, most people are pretty chill, and lots of people hang out by the corner outside to smoke/vape or talk about games/anime/sports on Slack.

A lot of the full-time employees worked 45+ hour work weeks. As a co-op, I didn't really have to deal with that, and pretty much worked 35 hours/week on average, as long as I got the work done. My manager and mentor regularly checked in with me, and they understand that you're probably there to get experience and care about your career goals. With that said, your experience will likely vary depending on your team lead, and it’s definitely not the case across all teams. According to the last co-op here, unless you put in like 50+ hours a week and implement features off the backlog “for fun”, you probably won’t be getting an Outstanding.

They do have some nice perks, including unlimited vacation days. There’s the typical tech company benefits with monthly social events, flex hours, free swag, a Christmas party, trips if the company meets their OKRs, foosball table, free pop, beer on tap (usually some craft beer), onsite massages every month, onsite gym and trainer, free snacks, 3 meals (restaurants are on a 3-4 week rotation). The food rotation is pretty sweet, and pretty much everyone goes for lunch as clockwork, which is nice. If you stay late, there usually is a dinner food order going on.",1200,"CAD","weekly","TextNow",66,,366,4,4,4,5
437,true,"The experience is very team dependent here. For people working on high-profile teams like AutoPilot, which is essentially its own organization, the hours are pretty intense and there’s a lot of pressure to deliver. And when there’s a deadline approaching (like Model 3 launch), there might be some pressure there. I know one of the interns working on critical components of Model 3 was putting in upwards of 70 hours per week.

The pay isn’t the greatest in the Bay area, but you’re eligible for overtime, so most interns end up working an extra few hours here and there. Some managers aren’t about that life though, and one of my friend’s managers told him to stop working so much overtime (he was only working 3-4 hours extra per week). They’re pretty chill about hours though, and taking time off to go explore California.

There’s a few intern events that go on throughout the term, and at least one off-site event. 

At DC, there’s free cereal (Happy Shapes, Crisp Rice, Raisin Bran, Corn Flakes) and drinks (soft drinks, coffee, orange juice, regular/almond/coconut milk). Some of the new offices have different cereal flavours or new drinks. There’s lunch and dinner from Rebecca Jean’s Catering that comes to around $7-12 per meal, depending on what you get. There’s also vending machines that sell food and a salad bar if you’re into that. Food trucks come by at lunchtime.

Orientation happens at Fremont, regardless of whether you’re working at Fremont or DC (not too sure what happens with Gigafactory interns or Design interns). You’re supposed to have weekly 1-on-1 meetings with your mentor to go over how you’re progressing, but some totally ignore it. There’s a midterm and final evaluation that Tesla does as part of their internship program, which is available to other managers if you’re returning.

Culture-wise, I’d say it’s fairly open. I found out about new products and direction pretty easily, although they’re trying to make that harder. Some projects have been becoming more secretive, which people are unhappy about.

I ended up working on stuff that was actually going into the cars, and learned a lot from my mentor and the people on my team. DC is an open concept office, so most people are pretty approachable (unless you’re in the labs downstairs). I finished my project pretty quickly, and then my mentor seemed to use that to gauge my abilities to assign more interesting work afterwards. Other interns barely finished a single project, and their evaluations reflected that. Overall, I’d say the internship is what you make out of it, and if they realize that you’re doing good work, they’ll give you more interesting work to do. Some of the new hires’ abilities seem suspect, but the Senior and Staff Engineers (at least the ones I interacted with) definitely know what they’re doing.

Tesla uses the TN visa, so they’ll probably have you fly through YVR. A lot of full-times are Canadians! They’ll cover round trip flights and provide a $2,000 relocation bonus (after tax), and will reimburse the visa fees. Returning interns get a $1 raise which I’m not sure is negotiable, but everyone I’ve talked to wasn’t able to negotiate anything higher. This includes 8-month co-op terms. There’s the standard tech company perks like a table-tennis table, etc. There's a small on-site gym, and you're eligible for a Wageworks card that gives you $120 for UberPool/Clipper Card per month. There's also biking benefits, which nets you $5 each day you bike to work.",28,"USD","hourly","Tesla Motors",220,,542,4,5,5,4

Pros
The developers know what they are doing
The tech they use is modern

Cons
Pretty much everything else

Company Culture
The company culture at Bespoke is the worst culture I have seen in a company. The full-timers are a close-knit group. They frequently make insulting remarks towards the interns and this behaviour is enabled by the group and CEO. People at the company do not understand proper workplace conduct. They are aware of this, and joke that they need HR but make no attempt to correct their behaviour.

Work-Life balance
Interns are urged to stay late, even though this is a 9 to 5 job. The CEO makes passive aggressive remarks when you leave early. This occurs even if there is no work. For a start up, it is normal to stay late and work hard, but the company culture was so terrible that no one bothered. Pro-tip, if you want interns to stay late, the trick is to make them want to stay late instead of shaming them into doing it.

Work Content
Interns often didn't have any work to do. On the team I was on, there was four interns being managed by one full-timer. He struggled to give any meaningful work to us. Often, there was no work in the backlog so we were assigned to write tests for code that he wrote. This was a failure of both management and the full-timers. The management has to ensure that there is always features that need to be developed and deployed and it is the full-timers responsibility to constantly update the backlog. None of this was done effectively. 

The CEO
Michael promotes this toxic company culture. He makes racist remarks, acts like an asshole and seems proud of the fact that no one can call out his behaviour. He has an astounding lack of self-awareness. He told the interns about the time he was working at a company and they told him to do HR training and he told them to fuck off. He also told a story about how he was competing with another white guy for a high ranking position at a company, he got in a competition with him and won, but did not get the position. He blamed it on the fact that the company management was racist. You don't think the two stories are related? I think it is likely that they didn't give him the position because he is a toxic, racist jerk that doesn't know how to interact with the people working under him.

In summary, the work is good and meaningful (when you get it). The company culture is terrible. The CEO is terrible. If you have another job on Waterloo Works, take that job instead.

From a technical/educational perspective, I worked with Java Spring on the back end team. When I first started I was given the right resources to get myself set up and familiarised with the code base. My teammates were highly experienced in the field but were also very helpful and approachable. I first started off with some simple tasks, but as time progressed I got assignments that were as important as any other full time developer's. One of the best educational advantages was that I had top tier programmers reviewing my PRs and giving comments/suggestions on how to improve my code. There is also plenty of opportunity to work on side projects through out the term. I had the chance to work on one of them and in the process gained practical experience with Angular, Node, and MongoDB. Different projects use different tech stacks, so there's room to learn a lot (including Machine Learning).

From a non-technical perspective, I met dozens of enthusiastic and laid-back people. Everyone knew how to have fun and understood that work isn't all about pushing out code. There was a ping pong table in the area where anyone could set up and play at any time. There were also free refreshments in the kitchen and almost always someone that was willing to sit down and just talk for a bit.

I worked at The Coalition, a game studio owned by Microsoft best known for the Gears of War series. They have an office in Downtown Vancouver (15 mins away from ""Big Park,"" the other MSFT office)

WORK:

Game development is hectic and haphazard, and unfortunately, I came in during a particularly busy time for my team. I didn't really have a chance to sit down with someone and ""learn the ropes,"" and I was instead thrust head-first into a task and told to ""figure it out."" 
Now, Unreal Engine 4 is a BEAST, and is not something that easily lends itself to ""self learning."" Pile-on all of the game-specific things you need to know, getting started in the codebase was incredibly difficult... 

Regardless, one of the (few) nice things about the ""diving in head first"" method of learning a codebase is that after you thrash around a bunch, you eventually get pretty good at figuring things out yourself! By then end of the term, I wrote code fairly quickly, and learned a bunch of invaluable skills in terms of navigating my way around a gargantuan C++ codebase.

LIFE:

This was the real highlight of the internship :D

1) I supremely lucked out with my team. The Audio Team at the coalition were some of the coolest and nicest people i've had the pleasure of working with. They really made the day interesting, and banter was always on-point. DISCLAIMER: i've heard from other interns that other teams were not as good, so YMMV
2) The Coalition has a super laid-back culture, with free beer and snacks every-other Friday
3) The intern-group I had was awesome, and made after-work events and weekends a ton of fun
4) Vancouver is a really awesome place to live. There is a ton to do, both within the city, and in the surrounding cities. There are lots of really cool hikes (if you're into that!)

MISC:

- Microsoft doesn't set you up with housing, which is annoying :( I was lucky enough to live with a friend from Vancouver, so his parents scouted out the place first, but otherwise you'd have to go in blind
- Housing is bloody expensive in downtown (I paid 1500/mo for a queen-size bed in a closet)
- The 5800 salary = 4400/mo base + 5000/term housing stipend + misc bonus monies

So if you are a returning Microsoft intern, who chooses the $9000 housing stipend, your total compensation for the internship would be close to $45k USD (equivalent $135k annual salary). In addition, Washington state (where Microsoft headquarter resides) does not collect state tax, so you would definitely get more money in your paycheque than your cali friends.

- Great mentorship and work-life balance. 
- Flexible hours and work from home policy
- Treated as full time member of team, with an equal say in team decisions
- Teams have a very large amount of autonomy, supporting different working styles. Some teams are very autonomous, while others rely heavily on pairing. Many teams are split across offices.
- Interns can lead Failure Friday, and motivated interns can go on-call for their team
- Functional programming is applied very widely; Many teams have most of their code in either Elixir or Scala, with only legacy code in Ruby
- Free lunch
- The people are very accommodating to different backgrounds and lifestyles. [Daddy|Mommy]Duty, for example, is a common term for when you adjust your work schedule so that you can take care of your kid. There are also various support groups within the company, like SisterDity and VeteranDuty. PD doesn't use ""culture fit"" as an excuse to exclude people, like some other bay-area companies do.

Cons:
- Some teams work mostly in (an exceptionally old version of) Ruby on Rails. 
- General growing pains as the company grows

I have worked in both offices. I would highly recommend anyone to intern at PD, but make sure you talk to a previous intern on your team to make sure it is a good fit. The Toronto office is better in every respect except weather and pay, with a more laid-back culture and better free lunch.

The lunch is exceptional. There was a wide variety of food from many different vendors each day. If you are in the Toronto office, I highly recommend Spicy Ethiopian day. In SF, deep dish pizza.

PD hires people from a wide variety of backgrounds, which is great. If you can code but you aren't in CS or Software Engineering, don't let that stop you from applying.

I would also recommend asking about their policies on affirmative action if that is something that is important to you.

- What tools does the team use?
- How much time is usually spent in meetings? How much of the time is spent working on new services and features, vs. polishing existing ones? Ops work vs. coding?

- I worked in the Hardware Tech org, the majority of which was situated in satellite buildings around Apple Park, but not in it. Instead of working in a bright, modern, open office, I worked in a claustrophobic, depressing sea of cubicles. 
- The manager who hired me was transferred right before I arrived, which meant no-one on the team really knew what I was supposed to be doing. I eventually worked on a project spearheaded by the team's former manager, but without him giving guidance and direction, the project stalled, taking nearly the entire term to finish.
- My team was incredibly antisocial, not just with me, but amongst themselves. Lunches were quiet, with no-one being able to start and sustain conversations. Laughter came in short bursts, with long stretches of silence in between.

That said, the area was quite nice, with the housing being pretty decent (shared-room, but I lived with someone I knew, so it wasn't that bad).

Apple Park is one of the most beautiful buildings I've seen in my entire life and they've recently opened it to all Apple employees. The facilities, gyms, etc are all top notch and in pristine condition and exactly what you would expect from Apple. 

From my experience, at Apple you'll get a shared private office with another co-worker. IMO it's way better than the crowded open office layout all the other tech companies have. YMMV though, some (unlucky) people have cubes.

Engineering orgs get free snacks/drinks but YMMV. 

Caffe Macs food is amazing, it's way better than the food they serve at Google but you have to pay a subsidized cost for it. The food quality is probably comparable to LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. 

Breakfast costs $2 (Avocado toast with half an avocado) or $3 (Acai bowl). There are other options like omelettes and breakfast burritos but it depends on which office you get placed in. Lunch costs between $5 (for an unlimited topping sandwich) and $12 (Scallops, Oysters, etc). Pizzas are $8 and are really good. Engineers get a $12 dinner credit past 7pm. 

Pay seems a bit off in all of these postings for some reason. My guess is that hardware/embedded/low-level SW roles are paying less than pure SW roles. I got paid 38/hr ($6600/month) + free corporate housing but I was really early in my co-op terms. You get paid by the hour and (with manager approval), you can work OT for 1.5x the pay. You can get around $42/hr ($7280/month) if you're slightly more senior. 

Corporate housing is a really nice 2BR place. They do stuff 4 people in that 2BR place though. This is pretty common, its done the same way in LinkedIn too. If you don't like having a roommate, I'd advise taking the $1000 post-tax housing stipend and finding your place around the Sunnyvale area (you can find a private room for ~1200 on PadPiper).

899,true,"""When you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags""

When you're working somewhere, it's often easy to get used to your surroundings and not notice anything wrong. I thought that my time at Bespoke Metrics was average, until I went to other companies to work and realized the smoldering dumpster of a workplace that this was.  

Internships should be an investment that companies make so that there are hopes that the interns will convert to a full-time employee that will require less training to get started. This is why Silicon Valley and top tech companies pay their interns an exorbitant amount of money to hire them, even though the company won't make that money back from the intern's work.

However, Bespoke Metrics hire interns because their core product requires cheap labour and what better way to get this than to hire poor students and then use the workterm evaluation as a ""carrot on the stick"" to overwork them?

In my term here, there were many serious issues with the full-time team. Some of the people are nice (4/13), but all the people who held key positions high up were the most arrogant and tactless people that I have ever met. You can read the other reviews to see the things that certain people have said, as that topic can be itself another review.

Also, if everyone in the company and their mother is a ""senior X"" does that ""senior"" keyword even matter? It literally becomes a label to inflate your ego, and it clearly has gotten to the heads of the people working here.

The work here was also really spotty. You can either be nuked with work, often a deliverable due by the end of the day or you would literally have nothing to do even if you ask your manager (I was told to 'read up on best practices' of certain libraries MULTIPLE times throughout the term). 

The work culture here is perfectly represented as waterboarding. Everyday is a fun game of Russian Roulette where your personal physical + mental health is on the line and the bullet is a truckload of work due before you are allowed to leave. Hours are insane when you are required to finish the work because the company needs this functionality to make money.

Also, as mentioned by someone else, they pay you biweekly, so you're doing volunteer work if you stay past 9-5, but you can't leave or else they will passive-aggressively comment on you 'leaving early'.

Back to the spotty work. I cannot imagine the time that I have wasted just waiting for time to pass. I started reading CTCI, fueled by the motivation of getting as far away from here as possible and ended up getting better jobs. I would say that this job is like that abusive cheating ex that you learn what to look out for in future relationships, but made your everyday life a living hell when you were with them.

Also, the management team comes from Finance backgrounds. This means that they bring the toxic ""time at work > everything else"" mentality that you find in Finance/Big 4 firms, which is insane. You have interns that are blackmailed and guilted to start work early, stay late, while often doing nothing. I sometimes wondered if this is what jail time looked like while working here. 

There have literally been times when the interns would play games together during work hours because they have no work and have asked if they can leave early for the day, get denied and then resort to doing something beside photosynthesize. Funny enough, the fulltimes would drop their work to watch. This raises a few key questions:

1. If the interns have 0 work and are playing games, why can't they leave? It's literally wasting everybody's time and adds to the electricity bill for a poor little startup.
2. If the fulltimes are just watching, is there no work that needs to be done? It's startup, there is always work. It's just that the engineers aren't doing their jobs and pulling in more work for the interns to do. I believe that work > no work, but there's no work and no one is trying to fix that.
3. Did we sign a job offer or a prison sentence? I'm locked up in a tiny and poorly lit room with a bunch of other horribly depressed people while being berated by management who literally would pace around to watch what we were doing.

Management, if you really do care about the interns, which I honestly doubt, I would start changing the way you treat them. There was legitimate harassment and bullying that happened to an intern during my term and they got depressed because they had to put up with this for 4 months. We aren't monkeys for you to play with or robots that idle until your next command. Please show just the normal amount of respect that you would show to someone else.

888,true,"A small company with a tightly-knit culture, and an interesting product. 
Scope for personal development as a tester isn't too much, and have to request for coding work repeatedly. Coding work would mostly involve writing unit tests.

The team has a great culture, but need to understand an issue completely before turning to blame the co-ops for any issues that they might be facing. 

Mentorship is very low with not much scope for personal improvement, and feedback is available once a month. They only provide the feedback after a delayed time which ends up being pointless as it doesn't address the entire need for timely feedback.

Overall, a decent co-op experience with its own set of ups and downs.

936,true,"TLDR: Awesome experience, great company culture, full ownership over projects, good modern tech stack with lots to learn, competitive pay (especially for earlier coop terms), perfect WLB and great mentorship. I would highly recommend this position if you are self-motivated and passionate about full stack web development.

Awesome opportunity to learn about all aspects of full stack web development, since there are only two full stack developer co-ops you will have full control over your projects, from ideation to development to deployment. There can be some downtime between projects, however if you take initiative and find problems to solve, you are more than encouraged to innovate new solutions for them. The projects solve real problems that LCBO faces, so your work will very likely go into production and have real users after completion.

Another great thing is the amount of freedom you have in your role, for example, the UI/UX designer on my term wanted to learn frontend development, whereas I spent my focus on backend and devops work and the other full stack spent some time on data science work. In terms of development, the tech stack is pretty widespread and modern, focused on the MERN stack for building web apps with supporting tools such as Elasticsearch, Redis and Docker, however we were highly encouraged to introduce new technologies if they see fit.

Company culture is amazing, the innovation lead and technology lead are both extremely chill and fun to be around. WLB is great, no pressure to deliver products fast, however you can accomplish a lot if you are motivated to do so. We did monthly team events on the last Friday of each month (VR, Escape Rooms), although they aren’t covered by the company, the high pay makes up for it. Mentorship used to be a problem in past terms, however a technical technology lead was hired in my term who providing us with technical help when we needed it.",4400,"CAD","monthly","LCBO Next",212,,488,5,5,5,5

First of all, you *will* get roasted by your manager, in front of everyone on your team during meetings. Everyone goes through this. You will get roasted for the most trivial of things, such as forgetting to update your tickets.

Second, this place is straight up corporate. Useless bureaucracy everywhere. Enterprise grade micromanagement. The team operates on waterfall. Virtually every piece of code you write (including bugfixes) requires you to write a big ass design document with a 20 page template, and you need to get that reviewed and approved by the team *before* *you* *can* *write* *any* *code*. After that's done, you have to provide detailed end dates for every task in your project. God forbid you miss one of those deadlines, because you're in for a roasting. We all know how good the software engineering industry in general is at estimating deadlines...

During your project, you have to provide constant email updates about the status of your project. Micromanagement nuff said. Forget an update? You're in for a roasting.

What's good? The people on the team tend to be smart, nice, and pleasant individuals to work with. Unfortunately the culture set by the leaders is straight out of office space.",52,"USD","hourly","Postmates",380,,655,1,1,2,1

Mentorship to me means being able to push me in the right direction when I am stuck, and at the same time encouraging me to figure out something on my own. This internship taught me how to be independent. I learned how to actually navigate source code in a large repository and understand code that I did not write. By far one of the best companies that I have interned at, in terms of becoming a better software engineer. Mozilla also flew everyone in the company to San Francisco for a work week, and we were exposed to different Mozilla products (e.g. Firefox, Rust, WebAssembly, AR/VR, etc.). Interns were also given a MacBook Pro 15"" (latest model) to take home after the internship.
