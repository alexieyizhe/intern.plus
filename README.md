## ‚ú® Design

Deploys through [Netlify](http://netlify.com) paired with Cloudflare DNS.

## üöÄ Development

To get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexieyizhe/intern.plus.git
cd intern.plus
npm install
npm start
```

This project follows a [trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) style. Branches are split off from the `master` branch for features, fixes, and all other development. The `release` branch contains production code that must always be kept in a go-live state.

#### Branch naming

Branches are prefixed with the following codes to denote their purpose:

- `feat[-XX]/`: A larger feature or enhancement for the site.
- `fix[-XX]/`: A fix or patch for bugs or errors.
- `chore[-XX]/`: Development on aspects with no production changes (documentation, refactoring, style).

Branch names contain the issue number on which the development efforts are focused, if any.

#### Commits into `master`

When branches are merged back into `master`, they must be squashed committed. The new commit name must be tagged with one of `[major|minor|patch]`, determined by [semver rules](https://semver.org/). This is used by CI when deploying.

Usually (but not always), the commit name is also prefixed with one of the following emojis based on the changes done in the commit, for better context when browsing on the `master` branch:

- ‚ú®: new feature
- üêõ: bug fixes
- ‚ôªÔ∏è: refactoring
- üíÑ: style changes
- üßπ: chore-related changes
- üìö: documentation
