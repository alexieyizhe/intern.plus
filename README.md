## âœ¨ Design

Check out [the mocks](https://www.figma.com/file/FyfrbCpoSGAeY3eTROqPx5/intern?node-id=0%3A1) on Figma! You can also watch a [timelapse of the design process](https://youtu.be/0Ioruq2xIXw) on YouTube.

## ðŸ¥ž Tech Stack

Created with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/).  
Developed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).  
Powered by [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/).  
Styled with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com).  
Tested through [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), [`cypress-react-unit-test`](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test) and [Percy](https://percy.io/).  
Code style enforced with [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).  
Continuous integration with [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).  
Deploys through [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## ðŸš€ Development

To get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexieyizhe/intern.plus.git
cd intern.plus
npm install
npm start
```

### Project structure

The project is split into the following parts:

- `/cypress` holds logic for the Cypress end-to-end testing suite tool, as well as E2E tests.
- `/backend` contains the code for the Django backend.
- `/src` contains the code for the React frontend:
  - `/api` contains client code for interacting with the graphql api.
  - `/assets` contains images, fonts, and other static assets.
  - `/components` contains all components that are shared between different parts of the project.
  - `/context` contains the global state management system.
  - `/pages` is relatively self-explanatory: it holds the pages of the app.
  - `/shared` contains all shared code like constants, etc that are used in _multiple_ parts of the project.
  - `/theme` contains all code dealing with styles and theming of the app.

For more information, consult the README in the root of each directory.

#### GraphQL

When in a development or test environment, the GraphQL API uses data generated by `faker` for local development.

All code dealing with GraphQL resides in `/graphql` directories. These directories are co-located next to the parts of the applications using them.

Each of these will contain logic like queries, fragments, etc. The types associated with the logic (auto-generated by Apollo tooling) reside in a `/graphql/types` subdirectory. The mocks for the logic (used in testing and local dev) reside in a `/graphql/mocks` subdirectory.

### Development conventions

This project (loosely) follows a [trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) style.

- Branches are split off from the `master` branch for features, fixes, and all other development.
- The `release` branch contains production code that is able to be hosted live.

#### Branch naming

Branches are prefixed with the following codes to denote their purpose:

- `feat[-XX]/`: A larger feature or enhancement for the site.
- `fix[-XX]/`: A fix or patch for bugs or errors.
- `chore[-XX]/`: Development on aspects with no production changes (documentation, refactoring, style).

Branch names contain the issue number on which the development efforts are focused, if any.

#### Commits into `master` branch

When branches are merged back into `master`, they must be squashed committed.

The commit name must be prefixed with one of the following, according to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines:

- `feat:` new feature
- `bug:` bug fixes
- `chore:` refactoringchore-related changes
- `docs:` documentation

#### Commits into `release` branch (releases)

When code is ready to be reflected on production, add a Github release with an appropriate version tag. This will trigger a Github Actions workflow that bumps the version according to the tag and pushes this to both `master` and `release`.

Any new changes on the `release` branch is automatically built by Vercel and made live.
