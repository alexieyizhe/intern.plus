## ‚ú® Design

Check out [the mocks](https://www.figma.com/file/FyfrbCpoSGAeY3eTROqPx5/intern?node-id=0%3A1) on Figma! You can also watch a [timelapse of the design process](https://youtu.be/0Ioruq2xIXw) on YouTube.

## ü•û Tech Stack

Created with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/).  
Developed in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).  
Powered by [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/).  
Styled with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com).  
Tested through [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), [`cypress-react-unit-test`](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test) and [Percy](https://percy.io/).  
Code style enforced with [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).  
Continuous integration with [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).  
Deploys through [Netlify](http://netlify.com).

## üöÄ Development

To get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexieyizhe/intern.plus.git
cd intern.plus
npm install
npm start
```

### Project structure

The project is split into the following parts:

- `cypress` holds logic for the Cypress end-to-end testing suite tool.
- `/server` holds some miscellaneous scripts and database migration stuff for use by the backend.
- `/src` contains most of the code:
  - `/api` contains client code for interacting with the graphql api.
  - `/assets` contains images, fonts, and other static assets.
  - `/components` contains all components that are shared between different parts of the project.
  - `/context` contains the global state management system.
  - `/pages` is relatively self-explanatory: it holds the pages of the app.
  - `/shared` contains all shared code like constants, etc that are used in _multiple_ parts of the project.
  - `/theme` contains all code dealing with styles and theming of the app.

For more information, consult the README in the root of each directory.

#### GraphQL

When in a development or test environment, the GraphQL API uses data generated by `faker` for local development.

All code dealing with GraphQL resides in `/graphql` directories. These directories are co-located next to the parts of the applications using them.

Each of these will contain logic like queries, fragments, etc. The types associated with the logic (generated by Apollo tooling) reside in a `/graphql/types` subdirectory. The mocks for the logic (used in testing and local dev) reside in a `/graphql/mocks` subdirectory.

### Development conventions

This project (loosely) follows a [trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) style.

- Branches are split off from the `master` branch for features, fixes, and all other development.
- The `release` branch contains production code that must always be kept in a go-live state.

#### Branch naming

Branches are prefixed with the following codes to denote their purpose:

- `feat[-XX]/`: A larger feature or enhancement for the site.
- `fix[-XX]/`: A fix or patch for bugs or errors.
- `chore[-XX]/`: Development on aspects with no production changes (documentation, refactoring, style).

Branch names contain the issue number on which the development efforts are focused, if any.

#### Commits into `master` branch

When branches are merged back into `master`, they must be squashed committed.

The commit name is usually also prefixed with one of the following emojis based on the changes made in the commit, for better context when skimming through the `master` branch history:

- ‚ú®: new feature
- üêõ: bug fixes
- ‚ôªÔ∏è: refactoring
- üíÑ: style changes
- üßπ: chore-related changes
- üìö: documentation

#### Commits into `release` branch (releases)

When a release is ready, a pull request should be made from `master` to `release`. This pull request title must be tagged with one of `#major|#minor|#patch`, determined by [semver rules](https://semver.org/). This is used by CI when deploying.

Once merged into `release`, CI will tag the last commit with the appropriate version number according to the pull request title.
