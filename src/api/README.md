### API

This folder contains the code for the Apollo GraphQL API client. The client is responsible for parsing queries/mutations and executing them to fetch data from the backend. It also has a mock implementation based on faker.js generated data for local development and test environments.

It also contains fragments for use with various queries around the app.
