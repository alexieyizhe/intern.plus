### Assets

Houses all assets used in the app. All assets are exported through the `index.ts` file so that changes to assets don't require changes across multiple places in the source.

`create-react-app` also [recommends that you import images](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/) so that Webpack can bundle the file and provide the correct path when building.
