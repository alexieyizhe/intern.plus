Return offers are also given directly after the internship with no extra interviews required.","reviewSalaryAmt":8000,"reviewSalaryCurrency":"USD","reviewSalaryPeriod":"monthly","overallScore":4,"learningMentorshipScore":5,"meaningfulWorkScore":4,"workLifeBalanceScore":4,"isSpam":false,"isLegacy":true,"rest":"NULL,'wwwwaawfafwafafawfawfa',0,0,NULL"},"ck1x0zvgq002v01jv6b7n5jkx":{"original":"('ck1x0zvgq002v01jv6b7n5jkx','2019-10-19 03:52:01.800000','2019-11-25 20:25:10.488227',1571459707,'ck1n1du49000501jo4pwygsav','This was my first developer internship.

I\\'m going to list out the pros and cons for this internship in detail since there are not many international students who intern here.\\n\\nPros: \\n1. It\\'s in Tokyo! Their office is in shinagawa and its so easy to get to any place in Tokyo. Weekends and evenings are always so fun. This is the main reason I give it a 5 star. If traveling or living in Tokyo for 4 months doesn\\'t excite you then maybe this isn\\'t the internship for you.\\n2. They put you up in a nice studio apartment close to shinagawa. For me, my apartment was in Tamachi station but I heard some people were in a different location. Either way it is paid for and pretty nice. It\\'s a little small but definitely enough for one person. \\n3. The Japan team only hires international interns on the office team and the office team in Japan unlike Redmond is very small. They only have the Sway and Docs.com team and a bit of Office Lens I believe. This is a pro and a con. It\\'s a pro because you get to know the team. It\\'s very open concept unlike Microsoft in general. The con is that you might not want to work on these products at all. \\n4. Companies in Japan have a interesting culture.

I'm going to list out the pros and cons for this internship in detail since there are not many international students who intern here.\n\nPros: \n1. It's in Tokyo! Their office is in shinagawa and its so easy to get to any place in Tokyo. Weekends and evenings are always so fun. This is the main reason I give it a 5 star. If traveling or living in Tokyo for 4 months doesn't excite you then maybe this isn't the internship for you.\n2. They put you up in a nice studio apartment close to shinagawa. For me, my apartment was in Tamachi station but I heard some people were in a different location. Either way it is paid for and pretty nice. It's a little small but definitely enough for one person. \n3. The Japan team only hires international interns on the office team and the office team in Japan unlike Redmond is very small. They only have the Sway and Docs.com team and a bit of Office Lens I believe. This is a pro and a con. It's a pro because you get to know the team. It's very open concept unlike Microsoft in general. The con is that you might not want to work on these products at all. \n4. Companies in Japan have a interesting culture. People there work reallllly late but this isn't true for Microsoft Japan. I mean people did work late but I never felt any pressure to do so. It would be like any other company in Silicon Valley etc. \n\nCons:\n1. Salary. You will not save any money if you come here.

There were 3 questions, one was string based(medium), the second was a dynamic programming(easy), and third was a dynamic programming(medium hard). Doing one problem was enough, though it depends on the actual rank list and not the number of problems you solve. This was followed by a debug round, a question on binary exponentiation. We just had to correct the code and submit within 15 mins.\\n\\nRound 1: This was a GoToMeeting interview. The interview was all about your resume. The interviewer asked about the projects in detail for about 30 mins and then in general everything about your experience with past internships and stuff.\\n\\nRound 2: This was an online coding round. I was given a question on binary trees, had to find the maximum sum path in the tree and code it up within 40 mins. The interviewer expects you to go step by step in this round, that is first you give a brute force solution and then progressively try to decrease the time complexity until the interviewer is satisfied. (Tip: Don\\'t jump to the answer directly even if you know the answer beforehand. They are not interested in the fact that you know a problem but they test your approach to a new problem.)This was followed by a general discussion about the resume again.\\n\\nRound 3: This was a problem design round, basically to check how you go about solving a problem and how much of your computer science concepts are clear. Firstly, the interviewer presented a problem about recommendations made on an online e-commerce website. I had to suggest how all this could have been done. Another question was to design a bot that wished your facebook friends automatically. Another question was about distributed systems, he posted a query which needed to be parallelized, and you had to discuss all the aspects of it.

Terrible experience all around.\\n\\nPros\\nThe developers know what they are doing\\nThe tech they use is modern\\n\\nCons\\nPretty much everything else\\n\\nCompany Culture\\nThe company culture at Bespoke is the worst culture I have seen in a company. The full-timers are a close-knit group. They frequently make insulting remarks towards the interns and this behaviour is enabled by the group and CEO. People at the company do not understand proper workplace conduct. They are aware of this, and joke that they need HR but make no attempt to correct their behaviour.\\n\\nWork-Life balance\\nInterns are urged to stay late, even though this is a 9 to 5 job. The CEO makes passive aggressive remarks when you leave early. This occurs even if there is no work. For a start up, it is normal to stay late and work hard, but the company culture was so terrible that no one bothered. Pro-tip, if you want interns to stay late, the trick is to make them want to stay late instead of shaming them into doing it.\\n\\nWork Content\\nInterns often didn\\'t have any work to do. On the team I was on, there was four interns being managed by one full-timer. He struggled to give any meaningful work to us. Often, there was no work in the backlog so we were assigned to write tests for code that he wrote. This was a failure of both management and the full-timers. The management has to ensure that there is always features that need to be developed and deployed and it is the full-timers responsibility to constantly update the backlog. None of this was done effectively. \\n\\nThe CEO\\nMichael promotes this toxic company culture. He makes racist remarks, acts like an asshole and seems proud of the fact that no one can call out his behaviour. He has an astounding lack of self-awareness. He told the interns about the time he was working at a company and they told him to do HR training and he told them to fuck off. He also told a story about how he was competing with another white guy for a high ranking position at a company, he got in a competition with him and won, but did not get the position. He blamed it on the fact that the company management was racist. You don\\'t think the two stories are related?

Terrible experience all around.\n\nPros\nThe developers know what they are doing\nThe tech they use is modern\n\nCons\nPretty much everything else\n\nCompany Culture\nThe company culture at Bespoke is the worst culture I have seen in a company. The full-timers are a close-knit group. They frequently make insulting remarks towards the interns and this behaviour is enabled by the group and CEO. People at the company do not understand proper workplace conduct. They are aware of this, and joke that they need HR but make no attempt to correct their behaviour.\n\nWork-Life balance\nInterns are urged to stay late, even though this is a 9 to 5 job. The CEO makes passive aggressive remarks when you leave early. This occurs even if there is no work. For a start up, it is normal to stay late and work hard, but the company culture was so terrible that no one bothered. Pro-tip, if you want interns to stay late, the trick is to make them want to stay late instead of shaming them into doing it.\n\nWork Content\nInterns often didn't have any work to do. On the team I was on, there was four interns being managed by one full-timer. He struggled to give any meaningful work to us. Often, there was no work in the backlog so we were assigned to write tests for code that he wrote. This was a failure of both management and the full-timers. The management has to ensure that there is always features that need to be developed and deployed and it is the full-timers responsibility to constantly update the backlog. None of this was done effectively. \n\nThe CEO\nMichael promotes this toxic company culture. He makes racist remarks, acts like an asshole and seems proud of the fact that no one can call out his behaviour. He has an astounding lack of self-awareness. He told the interns about the time he was working at a company and they told him to do HR training and he told them to fuck off. He also told a story about how he was competing with another white guy for a high ranking position at a company, he got in a competition with him and won, but did not get the position. He blamed it on the fact that the company management was racist. You don't think the two stories are related? I think it is likely that they didn't give him the position because he is a toxic, racist jerk that doesn't know how to interact with the people working under him.\n\nIn summary, the work is good and meaningful (when you get it). The company culture is terrible. The CEO is terrible. If you have another job on Waterloo Works, take that job instead.\n","reviewSalaryAmt":2200,"reviewSalaryCurrency":"CAD","reviewSalaryPeriod":"monthly","overallScore":1,"learningMentorshipScore":2,"meaningfulWorkScore":2,"workLifeBalanceScore":1,"isSpam":false,"isLegacy":true,"rest":"NULL,'wwwwaawfafwafafawfawfa',0,0,NULL"},"ck1x0zvhj00i901jv6gqy1m90":{"original":"('ck1x0zvhj00i901jv6gqy1m90','2019-10-19 03:52:01.800000','2019-11-25 20:25:10.488227',1571459707,'ck1n1du49000501jo4pwygsav','Great experience - friendly coworkers, well built tech, and gave a lot of freedom.',8500,'USD','monthly',5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,NULL,0,1,NULL,'wwwwaawfafwafafawfawfa',0,0,NULL)","reviewId":"ck1x0zvhj00i901jv6gqy1m90","reviewCreatedAt":"2019-10-19 03:52:01.800000","reviewUpdatedAt":"2019-11-25 20:25:10.488227","reviewDeletedAt":"1571459707","reviewBody":"Great experience - friendly coworkers, well built tech, and gave a lot of freedom.","reviewSalaryAmt":8500,"reviewSalaryCurrency":"USD","reviewSalaryPeriod":"monthly","overallScore":5,"learningMentorshipScore":5,"meaningfulWorkScore":5,"workLifeBalanceScore":5,"isSpam":false,"isLegacy":true,"rest":"NULL,'wwwwaawfafwafafawfawfa',0,0,NULL"},"ck1x0zvhj00ia01jvgvxe9l4g":{"original":"('ck1x0zvhj00ia01jvgvxe9l4g','2019-10-19 03:52:01.800000','2019-11-25 20:25:10.488227',1571459707,'ck1n1du49000501jo4pwygsav','Working at D2L was for my third work term and I could not ask for a better internship.

Also expected since they are a startup and hire around 13 co-ops per term.\n\nAbsolutely recommend Hubdoc for an early co-op.","reviewSalaryAmt":18,"reviewSalaryCurrency":"CAD","reviewSalaryPeriod":"hourly","overallScore":5,"learningMentorshipScore":4,"meaningfulWorkScore":5,"workLifeBalanceScore":5,"isSpam":false,"isLegacy":true,"rest":"NULL,'wwwwaawfafwafafawfawfa',0,0,NULL"},"ck1x0zvhk00iw01jv3skebcbe":{"original":"('ck1x0zvhk00iw01jv3skebcbe','2019-10-19 03:52:01.800000','2019-11-25 20:25:10.488227',1571459707,'ck1n1du49000501jo4pwygsav','Spring 2018, work was great, join infra teams for meaningful work',7000,'USD','monthly',4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,NULL,0,1,NULL,'wwwwaawfafwafafawfawfa',0,0,NULL)","reviewId":"ck1x0zvhk00iw01jv3skebcbe","reviewCreatedAt":"2019-10-19 03:52:01.800000","reviewUpdatedAt":"2019-11-25 20:25:10.488227","reviewDeletedAt":"1571459707","reviewBody":"Spring 2018, work was great, join infra teams for meaningful work","reviewSalaryAmt":7000,"reviewSalaryCurrency":"USD","reviewSalaryPeriod":"monthly","overallScore":4,"learningMentorshipScore":5,"meaningfulWorkScore":4,"workLifeBalanceScore":5,"isSpam":false,"isLegacy":true,"rest":"NULL,'wwwwaawfafwafafawfawfa',0,0,NULL"},"ck1x0zvhk00ix01jv0hex57ro":{"original":"('ck1x0zvhk00ix01jv0hex57ro','2019-10-19 03:52:01.800000','2019-11-25 20:25:10.488227',1571459707,'ck1n1du49000501jo4pwygsav','People were nice and good work culture even though it\\'s a government office.

If you were to return to Microsoft as an intern, your salary will get bumped to $7650 and you will receive a one-time bonus of $5000.

Work environment is very chill, the manager at the time (Danny) is an amazing person who truly cares for the coops. It\\'s also very informal so you have the ability to discuss things/projects however you want. You get to take on multiple tasks and you get to choose/use as many technologies as you like. By the end of the term you can be an expert in Javascript, Python or whatever you\\'ve wanted to become an expert on. The roles are also very flexible. Even though you may be hired in as a fullstack, if you want to do some data science/machine learning on a project, no one will stop you from putting heavy emphasis on machine learning while your team-mates work with the backend etc.. There is low stress on the job so you don\\'t have to worry about spending your freetime on any of the projects. The salary ($4400/month) is also pretty good considering the region and the best of all, the office is in the Tannery Communitech hub, full of events and food!

Work environment is very chill, the manager at the time (Danny) is an amazing person who truly cares for the coops. It's also very informal so you have the ability to discuss things/projects however you want. You get to take on multiple tasks and you get to choose/use as many technologies as you like. By the end of the term you can be an expert in Javascript, Python or whatever you've wanted to become an expert on. The roles are also very flexible. Even though you may be hired in as a fullstack, if you want to do some data science/machine learning on a project, no one will stop you from putting heavy emphasis on machine learning while your team-mates work with the backend etc.. There is low stress on the job so you don't have to worry about spending your freetime on any of the projects. The salary ($4400/month) is also pretty good considering the region and the best of all, the office is in the Tannery Communitech hub, full of events and food!

IMO it\\'s way better than the crowded open office layout all the other tech companies have. YMMV though, some (unlucky) people have cubes.\\n\\nEngineering orgs get free snacks/drinks but YMMV. \\n\\nCaffe Macs food is amazing, it\\'s way better than the food they serve at Google but you have to pay a subsidized cost for it. The food quality is probably comparable to LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. \\n\\nBreakfast costs $2 (Avocado toast with half an avocado) or $3 (Acai bowl). There are other options like omelettes and breakfast burritos but it depends on which office you get placed in. Lunch costs between $5 (for an unlimited topping sandwich) and $12 (Scallops, Oysters, etc). Pizzas are $8 and are really good. Engineers get a $12 dinner credit past 7pm. \\n\\nPay seems a bit off in all of these postings for some reason. My guess is that hardware/embedded/low-level SW roles are paying less than pure SW roles. I got paid 38/hr ($6600/month) + free corporate housing but I was really early in my co-op terms. You get paid by the hour and (with manager approval), you can work OT for 1.5x the pay. You can get around $42/hr ($7280/month) if you\\'re slightly more senior. \\n\\nCorporate housing is a really nice 2BR place. They do stuff 4 people in that 2BR place though. This is pretty common, its done the same way in LinkedIn too. If you don\\'t like having a roommate, I\\'d advise taking the $1000 post-tax housing stipend and finding your place around the Sunnyvale area (you can find a private room for ~1200 on PadPiper). \\n\\nInterns get access to Apple\\'s Employee Purchase Program for substantial discounts on Apple products, both for yourself and for your friends & family.\\n\\nApple\\'s University Relations team basically doesn\\'t host any intern events other than in the summer, but even then, there aren\\'t that many of them and they\\'re way too large scale since Apple hires so many interns.

IMO it's way better than the crowded open office layout all the other tech companies have. YMMV though, some (unlucky) people have cubes.\n\nEngineering orgs get free snacks/drinks but YMMV. \n\nCaffe Macs food is amazing, it's way better than the food they serve at Google but you have to pay a subsidized cost for it. The food quality is probably comparable to LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. \n\nBreakfast costs $2 (Avocado toast with half an avocado) or $3 (Acai bowl). There are other options like omelettes and breakfast burritos but it depends on which office you get placed in. Lunch costs between $5 (for an unlimited topping sandwich) and $12 (Scallops, Oysters, etc). Pizzas are $8 and are really good. Engineers get a $12 dinner credit past 7pm. \n\nPay seems a bit off in all of these postings for some reason. My guess is that hardware/embedded/low-level SW roles are paying less than pure SW roles. I got paid 38/hr ($6600/month) + free corporate housing but I was really early in my co-op terms. You get paid by the hour and (with manager approval), you can work OT for 1.5x the pay. You can get around $42/hr ($7280/month) if you're slightly more senior. \n\nCorporate housing is a really nice 2BR place. They do stuff 4 people in that 2BR place though. This is pretty common, its done the same way in LinkedIn too. If you don't like having a roommate, I'd advise taking the $1000 post-tax housing stipend and finding your place around the Sunnyvale area (you can find a private room for ~1200 on PadPiper). \n\nInterns get access to Apple's Employee Purchase Program for substantial discounts on Apple products, both for yourself and for your friends & family.\n\nApple's University Relations team basically doesn't host any intern events other than in the summer, but even then, there aren't that many of them and they're way too large scale since Apple hires so many interns. Orientation is only for half a day, so don't count on meeting many other interns during your internship unless you really make an effort to.

Definitely take this internship if you get a chance, you'll come out a 100% (or more) better engineer than going in.","reviewSalaryAmt":44,"reviewSalaryCurrency":"USD","reviewSalaryPeriod":"monthly","overallScore":5,"learningMentorshipScore":5,"meaningfulWorkScore":5,"workLifeBalanceScore":5,"isSpam":false,"isLegacy":true,"rest":"NULL,'wwwwaawfafwafafawfawfa',0,0,NULL"},"ck1x0zvhs00m601jvfhf552h0":{"original":"('ck1x0zvhs00m601jvfhf552h0','2019-10-19 03:52:01.800000','2019-11-25 20:25:10.488227',1571459710,'ck1n1du49000501jo4pwygsav','Great team,  really smart people, everyone is willing to help out.
