I'm going to list out the pros and cons for this internship in detail since there are not many international students who intern here.\n\nPros: \n1. It's in Tokyo! Their office is in shinagawa and its so easy to get to any place in Tokyo. Weekends and evenings are always so fun. This is the main reason I give it a 5 star. If traveling or living in Tokyo for 4 months doesn't excite you then maybe this isn't the internship for you.\n2. They put you up in a nice studio apartment close to shinagawa. For me, my apartment was in Tamachi station but I heard some people were in a different location. Either way it is paid for and pretty nice. It's a little small but definitely enough for one person. \n3. The Japan team only hires international interns on the office team and the office team in Japan unlike Redmond is very small. They only have the Sway and Docs.com team and a bit of Office Lens I believe. This is a pro and a con. It's a pro because you get to know the team. It's very open concept unlike Microsoft in general. The con is that you might not want to work on these products at all. \n4. Companies in Japan have a interesting culture. People there work reallllly late but this isn't true for Microsoft Japan. I mean people did work late but I never felt any pressure to do so. It would be like any other company in Silicon Valley etc. \n\nCons:\n1. Salary. You will not save any money if you come here. If you're using your internships to pay for school then re evaluate this internship. We got paid around 2.5 CAD before tax/health insurance. They do reimburse you for the flights though. I heard that the the term after us started getting paid 400000 yen which is about 4000 CAD (at least when I interned there). But even then Japan is an expensive place and if you want to travel and eat good food this money will be enough to live there but not to save and bring back.\n2. Language barrier. Fewer people than I expected spoke English in Tokyo. Get used to using google translate or learn some Japanese. This can sometimes be frustrating because buying milk can be difficult but at the same time if you're considering this then I assume you have some interest in learning about the culture and language.

This was a research lab which applied machine learning techniques to cancer research. The lab actively participates in machine learning competitions related to bioinformatics such as the DREAM challenges (as it is similar to the work done in the lab and it can improve your skill with similar datasets).\n\nAs a software engineer here I got to work on both machine learning competitions and software engineering work. For the machine learning competitions I cleaned and transformed data in R, then ran it through the pipeline of feature selection and extraction, then the actual algorithms, then maybe some stacking. The software engineering work was pretty standard and related to maintaining and improving the libraries that are in use by the lab. At the time of my internship the codebase was R (for science related tasks) and perl (for systems related tasks). There are some libraries which have grown convoluted over the years being written as one-off research code which then is hacked to be reused. As a software engineering intern I had to refactor some of this spaghetti code.\n\nEvery week there was a lab meeting where there was one small and one large presentation by lab members. This was interesting to me as I got to learn about the different projects people had and how they used different ML models in order to make sense of the biological data. Sometimes it was very biology heavy which did offset me from understanding what they were presenting.\n\nThe lab members were very friendly and helpful, being experienced in their respective fields of expertise. Usually there are also other interns doing either similar software engineering work or bioinformatics research. Most of the full time lab members are bioinformaticians with a handful of software engineers which was kind of intimidating since I don't know much biology so I feared talking to the bioinformaticians (which was probably a mistake as they are strong programmers for academic work, which has different priorities but nonetheless they probably know many tricks that I could have learnt, especially with manipulating data in R).\n\nThe lab is in downtown Toronto right next to a subway station and there is a food court at the bottom of the building with ~10 selections. Exiting the building there are many great food places just a 5-10 minutes walk away.\n\nOverall the experience was great and I learnt a lot. The things that I have learnt about and value most probably is the data science experience as I use it in the current internships that I have.","tags":null,"score":{"overall":4,"learningMentorship":4,"meaningfulWork":3,"workLifeBalance":3},"salary":{"amount":3000,"period":"monthly","currency":"CAD"},"salaryHourly":{"amount":18.75,"period":"hourly","currency":"CAD"},"author":{"name":"An anonymous reviewer","id":null},"companyId":"ck1x39p0c006001i9hy6q3f48","jobId":"ck1x3aimx00g401i9atjydccs","createdAt":"2019-10-19T08:56:45.467Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-26T01:25:10.488Z","isLegacy":true,"isApproved":true},{"id":"ck1x3b44j00wp01i95s1i9p4a","body":"A heavily funded and brand new start-up based in Toronto provided an awesome co-op experience.

Good food, outstanding pay, coworkers are awesome, get to work in OCaml, nice office. There's also fun dinners and events for interns and mentors. It's a fun and casual work environment with interesting technology, far from a stereotypical finance company.\n\nThe program is pretty structured. You do 3-5 self-contained small-ish projects, each one with a different mentor. Each one is interesting, takes a few weeks, and are often in a variety of different areas, which is nice. You don't get the same experience as a full time employee working on a team though.\n\nIf I was forced to find cons it would be the intern sandbox and the corporate IT setup. Interns are heavily firewalled with little access to the intranet and internal data, which is a bit sad since you can't actually see the things you make running in production. Also you need to use a CentOS computer without root access, the IT people are helpful and can install things for you, but only from the sparse and outdated CentOS repos. They have good reasons for both of these, but it doesn't stop them from being minor annoyances. You also have to do all your work on a remote server (but with sub-millisecond ping and gigabit bandwidth), which makes GUI editors like Sublime Text harder to use.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, that's just nitpicking. It's really a great place to work. I enjoyed it so much that despite getting 6 days of vacation I only took one, despite not knowing that I'd be payed out for the days I didn't take.

There were 3 questions, one was string based(medium), the second was a dynamic programming(easy), and third was a dynamic programming(medium hard). Doing one problem was enough, though it depends on the actual rank list and not the number of problems you solve. This was followed by a debug round, a question on binary exponentiation. We just had to correct the code and submit within 15 mins.\n\nRound 1: This was a GoToMeeting interview. The interview was all about your resume. The interviewer asked about the projects in detail for about 30 mins and then in general everything about your experience with past internships and stuff.\n\nRound 2: This was an online coding round. I was given a question on binary trees, had to find the maximum sum path in the tree and code it up within 40 mins. The interviewer expects you to go step by step in this round, that is first you give a brute force solution and then progressively try to decrease the time complexity until the interviewer is satisfied.

They are not interested in the fact that you know a problem but they test your approach to a new problem.)This was followed by a general discussion about the resume again.\n\nRound 3: This was a problem design round, basically to check how you go about solving a problem and how much of your computer science concepts are clear. Firstly, the interviewer presented a problem about recommendations made on an online e-commerce website. I had to suggest how all this could have been done. Another question was to design a bot that wished your facebook friends automatically. Another question was about distributed systems, he posted a query which needed to be parallelized, and you had to discuss all the aspects of it. Basically what the interviewer was looking for was that you understand your solution inside out and know about all of its shortcomings that may occur and then he would ask you to somehow solve these shortcomings.\n\nThis was all about it. It was a great experience interviewing with Codenation. Note that interviewing opportunity can only be obtained by participating in the Codeagon contest conducted by Codenation. I think you need to be in the top 100 or so for getting to interview. This first process may vary a little depending on a lot of things. So keep your eye on their facebook page for the update. About all the perks and the compensation, I feel that Codenation is transparent enough and has all the details mentioned on their website.","tags":null,"score":{"overall":4,"learningMentorship":5,"meaningfulWork":5,"workLifeBalance":4},"salary":{"amount":75000,"period":"monthly","currency":"INR"},"salaryHourly":{"amount":468.75,"period":"hourly","currency":"INR"},"author":{"name":"An anonymous reviewer","id":null},"companyId":"ck1x39p0s00bn01i98mmmhagf","jobId":"ck1x3ain300k701i9h68gbmal","createdAt":"2019-10-19T08:56:45.467Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-26T01:25:10.488Z","isLegacy":true,"isApproved":true},{"id":"ck1x3b44r012301i972r3hn79","body":"Honestly, the thing's that made it good were the company culture and coworkers.

This means that work/life balance suffers and there isn't much focus on having a chill work environment, so the workday tends to become dry and purely work focused.

A lot of the founders and upper management seem to have drank the Kool-Aid and think they're the greatest thing since sliced bread. There's also a structural disconnect between the two offices (Waterloo and Bangalore), where the culture of the Indian office seems to clash with the culture at the local office—one of the teams I encountered during my time there measured the state of a project by \"how many lines of code remaining to write\", which is a totally useless metric and given as an estimate at the start of the project.\n\nTheir technology is somewhat dated, although it varies by team. A lot of the company used an old VCS (IBM ClearCase), although they were beginning to transition to their own hosted Gitlab instance. Also, they have a lot of their testing infrastructure written in a rather esoteric language that nobody really seems to use anymore—Tcl. Java, C and C++ make up a majority of the rest of their codebase, although they were beginning to embrace newer technologies like Golang (for some newer services) and node.js (mostly for client-facing things). I think some teams use Python as well.\n\nI worked on the Subscriber Policy Broker (SPB) team, and the project I was given was pretty isolated from the rest of the team. It was a pretty important project for the company, and I basically had full control over it during my co-op term, which I drove to completion during my time there. As such, I didn't really have to deal with all the politics, and had little interaction with the rest of the team. Half of my team was remote (in Bangalore), and the other half was in Waterloo.\n\nFrom my perspective, it seemed as if the full-time employees would always be dealing with some sort of production issue during their on-call rotation, and would work rather long hours in order to ensure that their projects were on track. However, as a co-op, I didn't really have to deal with that, and basically did my own thing, working 35-40 hours per week.

My boss specifically took me aside at times to highlight important things both about my work and thriving in a corporate environment.

Work life balance is there as most of the company is just people looking to do their ~40 hours and enjoy life outside of work. The occasional weekend of overtime would be asked in order to hit a target date but this seemed to be a very infrequent thing. Cool product and the company looks to be heading in the right direction.\n\nA few footnotes:\n\n1. Company is aging. Ciena Ottawa is a lot of former Nortel employees, and the company really didn't hit their stride until recently. This has created a bit of a hiring gap where you have a lot of employees aged 40+ but very few in the late twenties/early thirties area. They've been hiring a lot of new grads so there is definitely youth there.\n2. Canadian pay. You can see their fulltime numbers easy enough on glassdoor and it's nothing exceptional as far as Canadian software goes. They have decent perks for employees who have stuck with the company for a bit, and I get the vibe that this is a \"work here for potentially the rest of your life\" kind of place. Having experienced both this environment and the much faster paced, swap companies frequently, higher paid environment of the states, I am not sure which I prefer. Two completely different paths which I believe both have their benefits.\n\nAnyways, as far as co-op goes you can't go wrong spending some time here.

In my position, I started off with some menial officework (documentation and other paperwork), and in the 2nd month started drafting work in Solidworks. The first two months were really boring, but the exposure to Solidworks was a good formative experience. After this, I started doing far more interesting work, which involved designing fixtures for CNC machines, which included figuring out what the purpose of each part was, actually designing them, and then getting quotes for the parts and having it made. This portion of the job was a great experience and gave exposure to both the technical and business sides of things. In my opinion, YMMV depending on which facility you are in, but it does seem that this co-op position provides some good opportunity if you're willing to put some effort in.

On the contract and in the interviews, they say that it's a 9-5 job, but realistically, it's at least 8:30-6:30. To give you an idea, one of the coops left at 5:30 in the first week and got called out by the CEO who happened to be by the door. We weren't even doing anything that first week other than some warmup coding exercises. Needless to say, no one wanted to be the first to leave, resulting in sad kids staying WAY past their designated hours because they're all pressured to stay and pressured to not look bad for the next four grueling months.\n\nAdditionally, the office is tiny. Smaller than a classroom on the 4th floor of MC. It's as big as a 3-bedroom suite that you would find off-campus, and imagine fitting in ~20+ employees (including co-ops). The kitchen is also small enough that it's literally a fridge, a sink and a counter that fits a microwave on top. You would literally be unable to fit 3 people in the kitchen all together at one point in time. There are absolutely no perks and you are expected to work during weekends too. The only thing that the office spent their money on was probably their blinds. No amount of sunlight got in the office and added to the depressing atmosphere.\n\nFurthermore, they say that they pay the average amount according to CECA numbers. But that is for a 37.5 hour work week. They pay you biweekly, so doing the math with the hours that I had stated above, you would be earning < 15/hr for work that should be worth more based on how badly the company needs it. Their product is just starting to get off the ground and it will be hell for people working here in Winter/Spring 2018. (read, stay past 6:30)\n\nSo in conclusion, do NOT come here unless you are ABSOLUTELY desperate. They hired 7 software interns and their fulltime team has 2 backend developers and 1 front-end developer. The coops had to code a majority of their backend, so you can imagine how fun it'll be to work with that. Already by the first few weeks, us group of coops were all regretting taking this offer, because literally any other company would at least let you leave before 6:30pm without feeling guilty.","tags":null,"score":{"overall":1,"learningMentorship":1,"meaningfulWork":1,"workLifeBalance":1},"salary":{"amount":1400,"period":"monthly","currency":"CAD"},"salaryHourly":{"amount":8.75,"period":"hourly","currency":"CAD"},"author":{"name":"An anonymous reviewer","id":null},"companyId":"ck1x39p0g008701i9efzsd70c","jobId":"ck1x3ain700mu01i90azshru9","createdAt":"2019-10-19T08:56:45.467Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-26T01:25:10.488Z","isLegacy":true,"isApproved":true},{"id":"ck1x3b459018s01i9azas8vl1","body":"$200 for bike, $100 /month for other housing\n$1800 per month for housing,\ncan work lot of overtime if you want/manager approves.","tags":null,"score":{"overall":4,"learningMentorship":3,"meaningfulWork":3,"workLifeBalance":2},"salary":{"amount":37,"period":"hourly","currency":"USD"},"salaryHourly":{"amount":37,"period":"hourly","currency":"USD"},"author":{"name":"An anonymous reviewer","id":null},"companyId":"ck1x39p0t00cc01i9g7vsf2c1","jobId":"ck1x3aimx00gh01i94ks71pfk","createdAt":"2019-10-19T08:56:45.467Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-26T01:25:10.488Z","isLegacy":true,"isApproved":true},{"id":"ck1x3b459018t01i95emr1bdf","body":"Technically is supposed to be ~$6500 per month but they make you work lot of overtime and you rack up those hours (~$8000)","tags":null,"score":{"overall":5,"learningMentorship":4,"meaningfulWork":5,"workLifeBalance":1},"salary":{"amount":40,"period":"hourly","currency":"USD"},"salaryHourly":{"amount":40,"period":"hourly","currency":"USD"},"author":{"name":"An anonymous reviewer","id":null},"companyId":"ck1x39p0s00c501i967hadv4e","jobId":"ck1x3aine00p701i98r17gxgr","createdAt":"2019-10-19T08:56:45.467Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-26T01:25:10.488Z","isLegacy":true,"isApproved":true},{"id":"ck1x3b459018u01i9ce3o9ml4","body":"Company culture is great.

They were aggressively hiring full-time employees when I worked there for both the San Francisco and Waterloo offices, as there was an extra signing bonus for new employees going on. However, at least 5 full-time employees left the company or were fired in the 4 months I was there, so take that how you will.\n\nMost of their old monolithic application is still written in PHP, with most of the newer services written in Ruby on Rails and Golang. Mobile applications are written in Java (Android) and Objective C (iOS), although they’re planning on rewriting in Swift at some point. Some custom firmware and other things are written in C, although for the most part this is legacy or pretty stable and doesn't really need to be touched. Web stack was pretty standard. Git is used for version control. CI builds run on most of the important repositories, and backend deploys daily.\n\nI worked alongside full-times mostly on backend (although I did fix a few CSS bugs and worked a bit on Android, iOS, and the ops side of things). You'll probably ship your first PR within the first 1-2 days. They have some smart Senior developers and ops-guys (and ex-Big 4 UI/UX designers) who know what they're doing. Unfortunately, most people have only been at the company for about 2 years, and are probably out of their element in many problems you'll encounter. iOS guys are generally good considering they’re all senior, and there’s a few who know Android really well.\n\nThere's a bi-weekly Town Hall where Finances, company updates, and product direction are discussed. User metrics are always available to everyone. This flat organizational layout means that things can get bumped up the priority list if \"higher-ups\" see a bug, and they will demand that it get fixed ASAP (usually via hot-fix the day of). Some of the business decisions regarding product direction are questionable, yet nobody seems to say anything about it. However, most people are pretty chill, and lots of people hang out by the corner outside to smoke/vape or talk about games/anime/sports on Slack.\n\nA lot of the full-time employees worked 45+ hour work weeks. As a co-op, I didn't really have to deal with that, and pretty much worked 35 hours/week on average, as long as I got the work done. My manager and mentor regularly checked in with me, and they understand that you're probably there to get experience and care about your career goals. With that said, your experience will likely vary depending on your team lead, and it’s definitely not the case across all teams. According to the last co-op here, unless you put in like 50+ hours a week and implement features off the backlog “for fun”, you probably won’t be getting an Outstanding.\n\nThey do have some nice perks, including unlimited vacation days. There’s the typical tech company benefits with monthly social events, flex hours, free swag, a Christmas party, trips if the company meets their OKRs, foosball table, free pop, beer on tap (usually some craft beer), onsite massages every month, onsite gym and trainer, free snacks, 3 meals (restaurants are on a 3-4 week rotation). The food rotation is pretty sweet, and pretty much everyone goes for lunch as clockwork, which is nice. If you stay late, there usually is a dinner food order going on.","tags":null,"score":{"overall":4,"learningMentorship":4,"meaningfulWork":4,"workLifeBalance":5},"salary":{"amount":1200,"period":"weekly","currency":"CAD"},"salaryHourly":{"amount":30,"period":"hourly","currency":"CAD"},"author":{"name":"An anonymous reviewer","id":null},"companyId":"ck1x39p0c005u01i900jw050f","jobId":"ck1x3ainc00nh01i9h7eobjbj","createdAt":"2019-10-19T08:56:45.467Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-26T01:25:10.488Z","isLegacy":true,"isApproved":true},{"id":"ck1x3b45a019j01i9b54p4jpz","body":"The experience is very team dependent here. For people working on high-profile teams like AutoPilot, which is essentially its own organization, the hours are pretty intense and there’s a lot of pressure to deliver. And when there’s a deadline approaching (like Model 3 launch), there might be some pressure there. I know one of the interns working on critical components of Model 3 was putting in upwards of 70 hours per week.\n\nThe pay isn’t the greatest in the Bay area, but you’re eligible for overtime, so most interns end up working an extra few hours here and there. Some managers aren’t about that life though, and one of my friend’s managers told him to stop working so much overtime (he was only working 3-4 hours extra per week). They’re pretty chill about hours though, and taking time off to go explore California.\n\nThere’s a few intern events that go on throughout the term, and at least one off-site event. \n\nAt DC, there’s free cereal (Happy Shapes, Crisp Rice, Raisin Bran, Corn Flakes) and drinks (soft drinks, coffee, orange juice, regular/almond/coconut milk). Some of the new offices have different cereal flavours or new drinks. There’s lunch and dinner from Rebecca Jean’s Catering that comes to around $7-12 per meal, depending on what you get. There’s also vending machines that sell food and a salad bar if you’re into that. Food trucks come by at lunchtime.\n\nOrientation happens at Fremont, regardless of whether you’re working at Fremont or DC (not too sure what happens with Gigafactory interns or Design interns). You’re supposed to have weekly 1-on-1 meetings with your mentor to go over how you’re progressing, but some totally ignore it. There’s a midterm and final evaluation that Tesla does as part of their internship program, which is available to other managers if you’re returning.\n\nCulture-wise, I’d say it’s fairly open. I found out about new products and direction pretty easily, although they’re trying to make that harder. Some projects have been becoming more secretive, which people are unhappy about.\n\nI ended up working on stuff that was actually going into the cars, and learned a lot from my mentor and the people on my team. DC is an open concept office, so most people are pretty approachable (unless you’re in the labs downstairs). I finished my project pretty quickly, and then my mentor seemed to use that to gauge my abilities to assign more interesting work afterwards. Other interns barely finished a single project, and their evaluations reflected that. Overall, I’d say the internship is what you make out of it, and if they realize that you’re doing good work, they’ll give you more interesting work to do. Some of the new hires’ abilities seem suspect, but the Senior and Staff Engineers (at least the ones I interacted with) definitely know what they’re doing.\n\nTesla uses the TN visa, so they’ll probably have you fly through YVR. A lot of full-times are Canadians! They’ll cover round trip flights and provide a $2,000 relocation bonus (after tax), and will reimburse the visa fees. Returning interns get a $1 raise which I’m not sure is negotiable, but everyone I’ve talked to wasn’t able to negotiate anything higher. This includes 8-month co-op terms. There’s the standard tech company perks like a table-tennis table, etc. There's a small on-site gym, and you're eligible for a Wageworks card that gives you $120 for UberPool/Clipper Card per month. There's also biking benefits, which nets you $5 each day you bike to work.","tags":null,"score":{"overall":4,"learningMentorship":5,"meaningfulWork":5,"workLifeBalance":4},"salary":{"amount":28,"period":"hourly","currency":"USD"},"salaryHourly":{"amount":28,"period":"hourly","currency":"USD"},"author":{"name":"An anonymous reviewer","id":null},"companyId":"ck1x39p0t00co01i99c619ygn","jobId":"ck1x3aine00pr01i9b0ci9fea","createdAt":"2019-10-19T08:56:45.467Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-26T01:25:10.488Z","isLegacy":true,"isApproved":true},{"id":"ck1x3b45a019k01i922ha14e6","body":"Great workplace environment and culture.

Terrible experience all around.\n\nPros\nThe developers know what they are doing\nThe tech they use is modern\n\nCons\nPretty much everything else\n\nCompany Culture\nThe company culture at Bespoke is the worst culture I have seen in a company. The full-timers are a close-knit group. They frequently make insulting remarks towards the interns and this behaviour is enabled by the group and CEO. People at the company do not understand proper workplace conduct. They are aware of this, and joke that they need HR but make no attempt to correct their behaviour.\n\nWork-Life balance\nInterns are urged to stay late, even though this is a 9 to 5 job. The CEO makes passive aggressive remarks when you leave early. This occurs even if there is no work. For a start up, it is normal to stay late and work hard, but the company culture was so terrible that no one bothered. Pro-tip, if you want interns to stay late, the trick is to make them want to stay late instead of shaming them into doing it.\n\nWork Content\nInterns often didn't have any work to do. On the team I was on, there was four interns being managed by one full-timer. He struggled to give any meaningful work to us. Often, there was no work in the backlog so we were assigned to write tests for code that he wrote. This was a failure of both management and the full-timers. The management has to ensure that there is always features that need to be developed and deployed and it is the full-timers responsibility to constantly update the backlog. None of this was done effectively. \n\nThe CEO\nMichael promotes this toxic company culture. He makes racist remarks, acts like an asshole and seems proud of the fact that no one can call out his behaviour. He has an astounding lack of self-awareness. He told the interns about the time he was working at a company and they told him to do HR training and he told them to fuck off. He also told a story about how he was competing with another white guy for a high ranking position at a company, he got in a competition with him and won, but did not get the position. He blamed it on the fact that the company management was racist. You don't think the two stories are related? I think it is likely that they didn't give him the position because he is a toxic, racist jerk that doesn't know how to interact with the people working under him.\n\nIn summary, the work is good and meaningful (when you get it). The company culture is terrible. The CEO is terrible.

Microsoft literally makes it rain for interns. For first time Microsoft interns (not explorer), you will get paid $7200 per month (per tax). If you were to return to Microsoft as an intern, your salary will get bumped to $7650 and you will receive a one-time bonus of $5000. On top of the base salary and bonus, you can either choose to live in a corporate housing (hella fancy one, with bi-weekly cleaning service) or a one-time $9000 housing stipend for your 4-month internship. So if you are a returning Microsoft intern, who chooses the $9000 housing stipend, your total compensation for the internship would be close to $45k USD (equivalent $135k annual salary). In addition, Washington state (where Microsoft headquarter resides) does not collect state tax, so you would definitely get more money in your paycheque than your cali friends.\nLast but not least, Microsoft also provides rental car program to interns. Basically, you can rent a car from a Micorosft-partnered car rental company with a subsidized price of ~$700 a month (Insurance and toll included). Having a car is blessed because you don't have to wait for the bus / uber everywhere.\nIn conclusion, I am so thankful that Microsoft really takes care of their interns money-wise and I would highly recommend Microsoft if you wanna cash out.","tags":null,"score":{"overall":5,"learningMentorship":5,"meaningfulWork":5,"workLifeBalance":5},"salary":{"amount":7650,"period":"monthly","currency":"USD"},"salaryHourly":{"amount":47.8125,"period":"hourly","currency":"USD"},"author":{"name":"An anonymous reviewer","id":null},"companyId":"ck1x39p0i009601i9ahsubxa9","jobId":"ck1x3aind00o601i94qi022db","createdAt":"2019-10-19T08:56:45.467Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-26T01:25:10.488Z","isLegacy":true,"isApproved":true},{"id":"ck1x3b45b01ah01i96eeh0zf2","body":"I was hired as a Software Engineer but managed to be placed on the Data Platforms team doing Machine Learning stuff after a quick interview with the Engineering Manager on the team.\n\nMy manager was great at figuring out what kind of skills I want to develop, and then create relevant tasks for me to do based off of that.

Some teams are very autonomous, while others rely heavily on pairing. Many teams are split across offices.\n- Interns can lead Failure Friday, and motivated interns can go on-call for their team\n- Functional programming is applied very widely; Many teams have most of their code in either Elixir or Scala, with only legacy code in Ruby\n- Free lunch\n- The people are very accommodating to different backgrounds and lifestyles. [Daddy|Mommy]Duty, for example, is a common term for when you adjust your work schedule so that you can take care of your kid. There are also various support groups within the company, like SisterDity and VeteranDuty.

I would highly recommend anyone to intern at PD, but make sure you talk to a previous intern on your team to make sure it is a good fit. The Toronto office is better in every respect except weather and pay, with a more laid-back culture and better free lunch.\n\nThe lunch is exceptional. There was a wide variety of food from many different vendors each day. If you are in the Toronto office, I highly recommend Spicy Ethiopian day. In SF, deep dish pizza.\n\nPD hires people from a wide variety of backgrounds, which is great. If you can code but you aren't in CS or Software Engineering, don't let that stop you from applying.\n\nI would also recommend asking about their policies on affirmative action if that is something that is important to you. \n\nQuestions to ask your team if you get an offer:\n- What tools does the team use?\n- How much time is usually spent in meetings? How much of the time is spent working on new services and features, vs. polishing existing ones?

The facilities, gyms, etc are all top notch and in pristine condition and exactly what you would expect from Apple. \n\nFrom my experience, at Apple you'll get a shared private office with another co-worker. IMO it's way better than the crowded open office layout all the other tech companies have. YMMV though, some (unlucky) people have cubes.\n\nEngineering orgs get free snacks/drinks but YMMV. \n\nCaffe Macs food is amazing, it's way better than the food they serve at Google but you have to pay a subsidized cost for it. The food quality is probably comparable to LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. \n\nBreakfast costs $2 (Avocado toast with half an avocado) or $3 (Acai bowl). There are other options like omelettes and breakfast burritos but it depends on which office you get placed in. Lunch costs between $5 (for an unlimited topping sandwich) and $12 (Scallops, Oysters, etc). Pizzas are $8 and are really good. Engineers get a $12 dinner credit past 7pm. \n\nPay seems a bit off in all of these postings for some reason. My guess is that hardware/embedded/low-level SW roles are paying less than pure SW roles. I got paid 38/hr ($6600/month) + free corporate housing but I was really early in my co-op terms. You get paid by the hour and (with manager approval), you can work OT for 1.5x the pay. You can get around $42/hr ($7280/month) if you're slightly more senior. \n\nCorporate housing is a really nice 2BR place. They do stuff 4 people in that 2BR place though. This is pretty common, its done the same way in LinkedIn too. If you don't like having a roommate, I'd advise taking the $1000 post-tax housing stipend and finding your place around the Sunnyvale area (you can find a private room for ~1200 on PadPiper). \n\nInterns get access to Apple's Employee Purchase Program for substantial discounts on Apple products, both for yourself and for your friends & family.\n\nApple's University Relations team basically doesn't host any intern events other than in the summer, but even then, there aren't that many of them and they're way too large scale since Apple hires so many interns. Orientation is only for half a day, so don't count on meeting many other interns during your internship unless you really make an effort to.

I thought that my time at Bespoke Metrics was average, until I went to other companies to work and realized the smoldering dumpster of a workplace that this was.  \n\nInternships should be an investment that companies make so that there are hopes that the interns will convert to a full-time employee that will require less training to get started. This is why Silicon Valley and top tech companies pay their interns an exorbitant amount of money to hire them, even though the company won't make that money back from the intern's work.\n\nHowever, Bespoke Metrics hire interns because their core product requires cheap labour and what better way to get this than to hire poor students and then use the workterm evaluation as a \"carrot on the stick\" to overwork them?\n\nIn my term here, there were many serious issues with the full-time team. Some of the people are nice (4/13), but all the people who held key positions high up were the most arrogant and tactless people that I have ever met. You can read the other reviews to see the things that certain people have said, as that topic can be itself another review.\n\nAlso, if everyone in the company and their mother is a \"senior X\" does that \"senior\" keyword even matter? It literally becomes a label to inflate your ego, and it clearly has gotten to the heads of the people working here.\n\nThe work here was also really spotty. You can either be nuked with work, often a deliverable due by the end of the day or you would literally have nothing to do even if you ask your manager (I was told to 'read up on best practices' of certain libraries MULTIPLE times throughout the term). \n\nThe work culture here is perfectly represented as waterboarding. Everyday is a fun game of Russian Roulette where your personal physical + mental health is on the line and the bullet is a truckload of work due before you are allowed to leave. Hours are insane when you are required to finish the work because the company needs this functionality to make money.\n\nAlso, as mentioned by someone else, they pay you biweekly, so you're doing volunteer work if you stay past 9-5, but you can't leave or else they will passive-aggressively comment on you 'leaving early'.\n\nBack to the spotty work. I cannot imagine the time that I have wasted just waiting for time to pass. I started reading CTCI, fueled by the motivation of getting as far away from here as possible and ended up getting better jobs. I would say that this job is like that abusive cheating ex that you learn what to look out for in future relationships, but made your everyday life a living hell when you were with them.\n\nAlso, the management team comes from Finance backgrounds. This means that they bring the toxic \"time at work > everything else\" mentality that you find in Finance/Big 4 firms, which is insane. You have interns that are blackmailed and guilted to start work early, stay late, while often doing nothing. I sometimes wondered if this is what jail time looked like while working here. \n\nThere have literally been times when the interns would play games together during work hours because they have no work and have asked if they can leave early for the day, get denied and then resort to doing something beside photosynthesize. Funny enough, the fulltimes would drop their work to watch. This raises a few key questions:\n\n1. If the interns have 0 work and are playing games, why can't they leave? It's literally wasting everybody's time and adds to the electricity bill for a poor little startup.\n2. If the fulltimes are just watching, is there no work that needs to be done? It's startup, there is always work. It's just that the engineers aren't doing their jobs and pulling in more work for the interns to do. I believe that work > no work, but there's no work and no one is trying to fix that.\n3. Did we sign a job offer or a prison sentence? I'm locked up in a tiny and poorly lit room with a bunch of other horribly depressed people while being berated by management who literally would pace around to watch what we were doing.\n\nManagement, if you really do care about the interns, which I honestly doubt, I would start changing the way you treat them. There was legitimate harassment and bullying that happened to an intern during my term and they got depressed because they had to put up with this for 4 months. We aren't monkeys for you to play with or robots that idle until your next command. Please show just the normal amount of respect that you would show to someone else. Please grow up.","tags":null,"score":{"overall":1,"learningMentorship":1,"meaningfulWork":1,"workLifeBalance":1},"salary":{"amount":2213,"period":"monthly","currency":"CAD"},"salaryHourly":{"amount":13.83125,"period":"hourly","currency":"CAD"},"author":{"name":"An anonymous reviewer","id":null},"companyId":"ck1x39p0g008701i9efzsd70c","jobId":"ck1x3ain700mu01i90azshru9","createdAt":"2019-10-19T08:56:45.467Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-26T01:25:10.488Z","isLegacy":true,"isApproved":true},{"id":"ck1x3b45g01cs01i9f2la7y77","body":"Small dev team, nice tech stack, free snacks","tags":null,"score":{"overall":5,"learningMentorship":3,"meaningfulWork":5,"workLifeBalance":5},"salary":{"amount":4000,"period":"monthly","currency":"CAD"},"salaryHourly":{"amount":25,"period":"hourly","currency":"CAD"},"author":{"name":"An anonymous reviewer","id":null},"companyId":"ck1x39p0s00c201i98ujv3pwk","jobId":"ck1x3aing00rx01i94pjgbhyp","createdAt":"2019-10-19T08:56:45.467Z","updatedAt":"2019-11-26T01:25:10.488Z","isLegacy":true,"isApproved":true},{"id":"ck1x3b45g01ct01i97szq1b5s","body":"I learned a lot from this position.
